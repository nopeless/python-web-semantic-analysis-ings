(I'm a bot)\n\nSweden's parliament has voted to give the Social Democrat leader, Stefan Löfven, a second term in office at the head of a new centre-left minority government, ending more than four months of deadlock following an inconclusive election.\n\nNeither bloc was easily able to form a new government without in some way involving the third-biggest party, the far-right, anti-immigration Sweden Democrats, with whom all other parties have refused to cooperate at national level.\n\nIf the former communists of the Left party, who like the Centre and Liberal parties abstained in Thursday's vote, decide the government is swinging too far to the right and vote against it, the opposition - the Sweden Democrats plus the two remaining centre-right parties, the Moderates and Christian Democrats - would have a majority.\n\nExtended Summary | FAQ | Feedback | Top keywords: party#1 vote#2 Sweden#3 Democrat#4 centre-right#5\n\n \n5\nRank by size \nTOP POSTS\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of January 18, 2019\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of January 2019\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2019"
