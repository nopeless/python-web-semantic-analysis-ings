The only way I can describe it is “squishy”.\n\nAgain, I’m incredibly sorry for the poor description, but I hope someone knows the answer to this, as I’m clearly clueless.\n\nEDIT: Once you open the bottle, the plastic returns to its original strength, almost like carbonation?\n\nArchived post.

But interested to hear from someone who actually knows lol\n\n1 more reply\noopleeaze\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI got one of those last week. I think it is because it got squished somehow just as the lid was put on. When I opened it, it had less water than the other bottles. Same thing though, plastic returned to original strength.\n\n1 more reply\nyadayadatennessee\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nLike when you try to open it it just squishes?\n\n1 more reply\nahmadove\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI think you're referring to a phenomenon called panel sink. There are multiple reasons for it:\n\nif the water is filled at higher temperature than it is stored, higher pressure is initially there, pushing against the walls protecting the wall integrity, but as soon it cools and the pressure drops (less heat = less energy = less average molecular kinetic energy = less pressure) the atmospheric pressure can squish it or just holding it can. Water may be added at higher temperature for controlling microbial growth. Water may also be bottled in the summer and sold in the winter.\n\nwater may be bottled in a factory at a higher altitude/elevation than it is sold/stored. This means it had less pressure acting on it from the outside when it was bottled (say some country with a slightly higher elevation, or some Alpine region, etc) and later it is sold somewhere lower and the increase in pressure outside squishes the bottle.\n\nsome materials like polystyrene or polycarbonate has a high moisture vapor migration. Meaning, water that evaporates inside the bottle can actually slowly crawl through the wall material and evaporate on the outside. This slowly decreases the amount of water inside, reducing the internal pressure. Again, allowing squishing.\n\ncould be manufacturing issues. Less optimized factory conditions like some sort of mechanical squishing of the bottle while holding it to label or cap it causes it to have slightly smaller volume before sealing and then the external squishing is released after sealing and you can regain the wall shape because you can't suck external air anymore (sealed).\n\nthese reasons can easily be exacerbated if you use thinner walls to reduce plastic (for environmental reasons). And this is being done in a lot of companies.\n\nHere is a ref (non science) if you like: https://www.tricorbraun.com/insights/thought-leadership/addressing-panel-sink-in-plastic-bottles/\n\nCommander-Grammar\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nIt’s either pressure or temperature change. If it’s bottled at a higher altitude it will compress a little bit as it’s shipped to you. When you open it, the slight vacuum is relieved and the bottle appears to get stronger as it returns to its intended shape. Same thing would happen with a temperature change. Look up pictures of potato chip bags at high altitude. It’s the opposite of that.\n\n \n24\nRank by size \nr/todayilearned\nTIL: The Prionailurus rubiginosus or \"Rusty Spotted Cat\" is the world's smallest cat.
