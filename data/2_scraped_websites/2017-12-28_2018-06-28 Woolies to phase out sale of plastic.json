  "body": "It would be because of the bids to ban plastic straws in Australia, and the bans already passed in places in Europe. Also, because customers just see the company removing plastic bags, see it as nothing more than raising profits by charging 15c for bags, so they now have to do even more to please the never-happy customer base.",

They only just increased it in the first place!\n\n13 more replies\nWhoreganised_\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nHaving worked in both Laboratories and Hospitals - the amount of plastic packaging waste that's generated surely has about the same impact. And there's fuck all recycling or waste separation going on, aside from the obvious clinical/biohazard shit.\n\n11 more replies\nsandgroper07\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nSo back to being able to buy things loose instead of a dozen snow peas wrapped on a tray .\n\n11 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n6 yr. ago\nlachlanhunt\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nWhat's the alternative to plastic straws? Of all the plastic products they sell, that seems like a very arbitrary one to single out for elimination without saying what the alternative is.\n\n24 more replies\nsj2can\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nBuy a titanium straw guys. I bought mine over 5 years ago, was about $10ish delivered. Stays icy cold with cool drinks too + no flavor.\n\nPS - Coles/Woolies need to zero the use of plastic for vegetables, its a horrendous misuse of our environment.\n\n7 more replies\n-businessskeleton-\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nI bought some of those metal straws.... DO NOT drink hot soup through them!\n\nAlmost burned my lip\n\nFireLucid\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nThey used to have a huge bin out the front to put your plastic bags into for recyclying. I saw it being emptied into the dumpster. Apparently ACA type shows have put trackers in there. All ends up in landfill.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nWhy the fuck would you get rid of straws?\n\n[deleted]\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nOn a semi related note to people who think plastic bags \"MUST\" be phased out. What do you think 90% of people use for bin liners?\n\nJust seems really stupid\n\n34 more replies\ngikku\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nand Milk bottles? juice, cordial, yoghurt, butter, ice cream, potatoes, coke,...\n\nRainAndWind\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nWhat an awful decision regarding the plastic straws. I barely know of anyone that uses them anyway, so why get rid of them, let the choice be there. I somewhat understand the rest of the packaging stuff.\n\nAlso.. Australia doesn't have a plastic pollution problem! The vast vast vast majority of the plastic that reaches the ocean comes from like 5 rivers in china.\n\npurpleherbivore\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nThat is terrible reasoning. 1. The fact that you don't know people using straws does not imply there are no people using straws. 2. If China has a bigger pollution problem does not imply that Australia doesn't have one!
