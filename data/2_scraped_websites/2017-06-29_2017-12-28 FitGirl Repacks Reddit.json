One day, I boot the game and it starts lagging and freezing horribly. Not only that, but my pc also lags, opening other apps takes like 7 seconds, and my keyboard reacts quite slowly when I type something as well.\n\nI tried reinstalling the game, and rebooting Windows upon each installation as recommended, but it doesn't work.\n\nAfter a lot of research, my issue seemed similar to this post, but the steps didn't help much\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/FitGirlRepack/comments/v5o5wi/fixed_crashing_issues_with_kingdom_hearts_1525_in/\n\nexcept that it's only KH 1.5+2.5 which lags but it doesn't crash, My other games like Danganronpa and Cuphead, and even Kingdom Hearts 3+ Re:mind, downloaded previously in 2021 from FitGirl, with Windows 10, still work just fine. I can't afford buying the game, but I really like this series...\n\nPlease help! and thanks in advance.\n\nView full post\nu/ShhDontTell-\n‚Ä¢\n23 hr. ago\nInstall on powerful PC first then transfer/copy?\nHELP/QUESTION\n\nI have a Legion Go (handheld computer, basically). Can I download and install a repack on my regular, much more powerful laptop, and then simply copy the installed game?

Every I get the unarc.dll error -11 decompression fails error.\n\nGoogling the error brought up some threads where people had to turn down their cpu performance and it would fix it. I have a I9 14900K that you would think would just chew through any install. I'm not sure how I would try to hamstring the cpu to try that fix.\n\nDoes anyone know how I would do that or If I'm looking in the wrong place for a fix.

Haven't really experienced issues from both these repackers except their Far Cry 3 repacks, which is fine. My problem though with Arkham City is after I've downloaded the game, the checking shows 41 missing files and 1 bad file. The bad file was the steamapi.dll file so I just went and restored that in Windows Security. I ignored the 41 missing files and launched the game. It then hit me what those missing files were. They were the cutscene and intro files. I've then deleted the game and the setup folder and I am now downloading a fresh copy of the setup without excluding the other languages. Any idea on why that happens?? Would love to know why so if it happens again I can take care of it. I will be running the setup in safe mode just to be safe (hehe see what I did there??)\n\nEdit: so uhhh I've downloaded it in safe mode. And the 41 missing files problem is still there! hooray! I am at a dead end here, I've rehashed the torrent, downloaded all the files including all the language ones, downloaded in safe mode, and the issue still persists.\n\nView full post\nu/NVIDIAOFFICIAL\n‚Ä¢\nPromoted\nThe ultimate cloud gaming combo. üå©Ô∏è\n\nFor a limited time, get a 3-month GFN membership with purchase of a Chromebook Plus. ü§ù\n\ngoogle.com\nLearn More\nu/Own_Cicada4318\n‚Ä¢\n1 day ago\nIs this slow?\nHELP/QUESTION\nu/Some_thing_like_vr\n‚Ä¢\n2 days ago\nFitgirl repacks site - not loading\nHELP/QUESTION\n\nwhen I tried entering the website, all it did was just load, load, and load... until this masterpiece appears\n\n\"\n\nThis site can‚Äôt be reached\n\nThe connection was reset.\n\nTry:\n\nChecking the connection\n\nChecking the proxy and the firewall\n\nRunning Windows Network Diagnostics\n\nERR_CONNECTION_RESET \"\n\nalso, my DNS is changed, my country's ISPs don't care about piracy (well mostly), and I tried with a VPN, but no luck.\n\nTried on 4 different browsers, but no luck.\n\nSo can anyone dearly help me?
