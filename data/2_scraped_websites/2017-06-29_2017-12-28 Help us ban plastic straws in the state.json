Even the club I work at has gone back and forth between biodegradable and plastic due to the members throwing a fit. We just got back on the biodegradable train, thank goodness.",

They still have to be manufactured and the ones Iâ€™ve seen use a corn base and are compostable. But Iâ€™m not sure how much corn it takes to make the straws. Maybe yâ€™all are using something completely different too.\n\nSo basically I guess my question is whatâ€™s the side effect of millions of people using biodegradable straws during the manufacturing process?\n\n2 more replies\ntayyylooor\nâ€¢\n6 yr. ago\n\nYeah San Diego!\n\n \nr/ZeroWaste\nRandom Thoughts, Small Questions, and Newbie Help â€” December 10 â€“ December 23\n3 upvotes Â· 1 comment\nTOP POSTS\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of October 14, 2017\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of October 2017\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2017"
