What's up with that?\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nvibes2high250\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThere's still 19 days left of this year\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nsubaruforesters\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nStraws aren't kept out anymore, you have to ask for them. We have new lids so you don't need a straw for almost every drink. We can't completely get rid of straws because some people require them due to a disability.\n\nReply\nreply\nBeap92\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nStraws were never the actual environmental issue people made them out to be, people with disabilities need to use plastic straws, individually packaged straws are probably more sanitary than putting your mouth on the lids we have to touch to get them on the cups, Starbucks is never going to stop Frappuccinos, or other iced drinks topped with whipped cream..... is that enough?\n\nReply\nreply\nchaoticmuppet\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nWe technically have straws at my store but we use strawless lids. Do they have the strawless lids?\n\nReply\nreply\nswvn9\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nStarbucks has alternate lids for strawless that have a smaller hole than nitro lids, hopefully your distribution centres are just exhausting existing stock before they ship the new ones\n\nReply\nreply\nAbrakadanni\n•\n3 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 3 yr. ago\n\nStores have to run out of their straw lids before they use the new strawless lids. My store still has tall straw lids so we will use them until they run out and then use the straw (edit strawless) lids. Pretty sure Starbucks will always have straws though. Now you just have to ask for one.\n\nReply\nreply\nBludandy\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nWe still have them, and customers get REAL fucking serious over them not being paper and go on and on about it and how they hate paper straws.\n\nReply\nreply\nRacerM53\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nPeople were probably complaining about the paper straws\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/starbucks\nStarbucks loses $11 billion in value amid boycotts\nnewsweek\n679 upvotes · 203 comments\nr/TheTryGuys\nTry Guys Test A Drunk Obstacle Course\nyoutube\n133 upvotes · 39 comments\nr/TheTryGuys\nThe Try Guys Make Oreos Without A Recipe\nyoutube\n135 upvotes · 56 comments\nr/goodmythicalmorning\nWe're Done Trying\nyoutube\n129 upvotes · 63 comments\nr/goodmythicalmorning\n2500th Episode Celebration Special\nyoutube\n127 upvotes · 46 comments\nr/Costco\nToilet paper (WA)\n53 upvotes · 49 comments\nr/unpopularopinion\nPaper straws taste like SH*T\n120 upvotes · 40 comments\nr/youtubedrama\nThe Completionist’s Open Hand Charity Scam Has To Be Investigated...\nyoutube\n104 upvotes · 28 comments\nr/youtubedrama\nOz's fundraiser livestream\nyoutube\n160 upvotes · 57 comments\nr/Pennsylvania\nNot complaining, but how do 'take out drinks' not violate open container laws?\n3 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/bingingwithbabish\nBinging with Babish: The Every Burger from Rick and Morty\nyoutube\n149 upvotes · 29 comments\nr/Purdue\nIn September, my roommates and I started keeping the cup lids from the dining courts\n158 upvotes · 11 comments\nr/publix\nOur customers have been so ridiculous over BOGO bottles of cooking oil, that we had to reduce the limit to 4.\n32 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/Albuquerque\nCan people chill out on toilet paper purchasing?\n150 upvotes · 60 comments\nr/bingingwithbabish\nBinging With Babish Eats His Last Meal\nyoutube\n458 upvotes · 21 comments\nr/Paramore\n“Somebody is getting fired!”\ntiktok\n241 upvotes · 32 comments\nr/BeautyGuruChatter\nNew Grooming Allegation Against James Charles\ntiktok\n430 upvotes · 93 comments\nr/NoahKahan\nNoah Kahan in tears over his Grammy Nomination\ntiktok\n249 upvotes · 10 comments\nr/porterrobinson\nThe instrumental for \"GTFO\" by Mariah Carey is literally just Goodbye To A World\nyoutube\n110 upvotes · 45 comments\nr/OliviaRodrigo\n'bad idea, right?' is featured in the new trailer of ‘ANYONE BUT YOU’ (2023)\nyoutube\n113 upvotes · 13 comments\nr/JennaGraceSnark\nGO OFF MATT😂🥰\ntiktok\n132 upvotes · 55 comments\nr/Vocaloid\nHatsune Miku wins the grand prize for the 2023 Japan Naming Award, which awards outstanding product names that contribute to life and culture.\nyoutube\n166 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/OliviaRodrigo\nOlivia Rodrigo - Can’t Catch Me Now (Official Music Video)\nyoutube\n122 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/brockhampton\nMelon's review of Blanket dropped\nyoutube\n142 upvotes · 54 comments\nr/poppunkers\nOpinion: The Last Song by The All-American Rejects is a pop/pop-punk masterpiece!\nyoutube\n118 upvotes · 27 comments\nTOP POSTS\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of December 12, 2020\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of December 2020\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2020"
