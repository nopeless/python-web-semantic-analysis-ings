We solved the plastic crisis!\n\nReply\nreply\nMouseBusiness8758\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nYou do know that in shipping these things can get absolutely ruined in so many ways right? Im not advocating doe that much plastic, but it does need at least one plastic covering as boxes get drenched accidentally all the time which would absolutely ruin your straws.\n\nReply\nreply\niheartzombies8\n•\n1 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 1 yr. ago\n\nEach color likely runs on its own line at a plant and is packaged that way. It's a waste of material but you save more money in time, by then combining them.\n\nAlso (edit): boxes take up more space. When you're putting these on a pallet and then transporting via truckload, you don't want to pay to ship air. So using boxes would mean less product per unit load, AND a heavier gross weight. Which increases cost.\n\nReply\nreply\nHaddonfieldShape\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nHuMaNs ArE tHe ReAl AnImAlS\n\nReply\nreply\njonmpls\n•\n1 yr. ago\n \nTop 4%\nRank by size \nr/Anticonsumption\na plastic trinket that will pollute the planet for centuries to come instead of an infinitely reusable metal fork\n467 upvotes · 43 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nThis TRANSPARENT ENGINE is Fascinating (How Engines Work) - Smarter Every Day 292\nyoutube\n203 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
