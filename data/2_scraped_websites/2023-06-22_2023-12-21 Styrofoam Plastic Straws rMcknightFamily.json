Now it’s biting a straw next it’ll be “omg I breathe through my nose. So crazy haha”\n\nReply\nreply\noneghoulishgal\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nEverything is “omg am I the only one who does ___?!” No girl you aren’t 😭😭\n\nReply\nreply\nCareless_Ad3968\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nThey're the poster women for excessive consumption, I wouldn't expect anything less from them.\n\nMan, on the subject of Sip City, Brooklyn and Brokota just went the Lash Next Door route. Slapped their brand on Shein stuff (Swig) and went from there.\n\nReply\nreply\nxoxodreamgirl\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nShe’s so quirky for biting her straw!\n\nReply\nreply\nExcellent-Suit-7082\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nSip City has branded Stanley cups that the whole family bought which were probs pretty expensive. These girls are getting drinks almost every day there and they can’t use the reusable cups even some of the time?… They just don’t care.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nLovemydoggos21\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nOk but it looks like the straw is going up her nose\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\noogleyshaboogley\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nIt’s getting so cringe to watch Bailey constantly grasping at straws for “relatable” content…. No pun intended\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nmooregatehoe\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nPretty sure in canada both the styrofoam cup and straw are banned\n\nReply\nreply\ncbags88\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nAs an Aussie is crazy seeing plastic and styrofoam things being used in take away, 90% if places probably more are paper and cardboard. Plastic straws are even banned\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\ninternsearcher25\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nAlso from NZ and it's so sad how wasteful everything they do is. NZ isn't by any means a pinnacle of sustainability and ive seen very wasteful influencers and people here but they're another level. They even drink from plastic bottles\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nEggLikeHuman\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nWow, why would they choose to use styrofoam? Styrofoam has been banned in my country for years, we barely see any now.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nthat’s crazy! shes like legit the only person that bites on straws! 😻😻\n\nReply\nreply\nhappysewing\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nThis... is content?\n\nReply\nreply\ncohen63\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nNot to Stan here but this debate about plastic straws for paper straws is totally not worth it. Snark if you want but I honestly hate paper straws because 90% of the time I need 2 or 3 to finish my drink because it gets too soggy\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nYesss i can’t even snark on them for that bc I will choose plastic straws over paper ones any day and I know I should be better. I just hate the way the drinks taste out of a paper one… but Starbucks uses compostable plastic straws so maybe the sip city uses them too? I can’t tell the difference lol\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nArmymom96\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nSo get reusable straws. We haven't used straws from a restaurant in about 5 years. They take 2 seconds to wash. C'mon people. It's not that hard to do little things for the planet that add up. This sub especially seems full of people who don't give a rat's ass. Downvote me all you want.\n\nReply\nreply\n4 more replies\nporkrindloaf\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nThey probably were the cheapest option so they ordered a ton... a bad choice on their part\n\nReply\nreply\namandamarie0701\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nI rather have a plastic straw then a crappy paper one any day\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 8%\nRank by size \nr/AskIreland\nStyrofoam disposal\n1 upvote · 7 comments\nr/EdSheeran\nLet Her Go ft.
