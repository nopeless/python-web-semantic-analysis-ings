Heat kind of is vibration of Atoms. The hotter something is, the more it's Atoms vibrate / move. Since the forces between atoms force them into a fixed distance between one another, they need room when a material gets hotter. So the material expands. Metals expand in every direction since the atoms in metals are (more or less) neatly stacked. Plastics are another case since they aren't made up of one sort of atoms but complex molecules. These molecules build chains and sometimes more complex constructs. Now some of these have configurations that can kind of flip when heat is applied. If the configuration the plastic enters while heated takes up less room than the room temperature configuration it shrinks.\n\n4 more replies\nshapu\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nPlastics are often not regularly-aligned (the terminology used to describe the way that molecules are aligned uses the words amorphous or semi-crystalline to describe most consumer-good plastics, instead of crystalline). Amorphous molecules take up more space because they are less regular - consider a pile of socks versus socks in your drawer. The heating of plastics allows the molecules to unfold from their amorphous shape and, as it cools, to re-align in a more \"comfortable,\" for lack of a better term, crystalline alignment.\n\nThere's also the fact that plastics are made up of a class of compounds called hydrocarbons. As they heat up, these hydrocarbons may start to degrade into smaller parts which have low boiling points. As the plastic is heated some molecules may start to boil off, reducing the total amount of material in the plastic. Try weighing a dry, empty milk jug. Then heat it up and let it start to change shape and such (but don't let it burn!). When you weigh it again you'll probably find that some of the mass has actually gone away. This doesn't happen with metals since most metals have very high boiling points.\n\nbslay25\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThere are a lot of different things going on within materials that are not easy to explain.\n\nIn this case, the easiest explanation is that all materials have a \"thermal expansion coefficient.\" Now most materials will have a positive coefficient, which means it will expand upon hearing. A few materials will have a negative coefficient, which means it will shrink upon heating. These coefficients are determined by testing methods.\n\nMore detailed is that all materials have a structure: metals have a crystal lattice that repeats (generally) but polymers have a structure that is completely random and can lead to a larger initial volume. Think of packing a box: if you throw things in at random, sometimes you cannot fit as much in there as you could if you did it systematically and by stacking. As heat is applied, the polymer strings basically try to orient themselves, which sometimes actually allow them to better stack themselves and shrink the overall volume that they occupy.\n\nfullofspiders\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nELI5 version: heat causes the material to grow. Some things we think of materials are more like structures. When the material the structure is made of expands in the heat, it can collapse, forming a denser, smaller structure.\n\nmitom2\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nyou are in your kindergarden-group of about 20 kids. you all stand very close to each other. the kindergardener now says: \"grab with your right hand a left hand and with your left hand a right hand. make one big circle and spread your arms wide.\". this circle is now stable. you cannot move freely, as long as your arms are spread and you hold each other's hands. this is similar to the plastics you know. they are heated for a short time, then they are expanded like your circle, and in that position, they are cooled down. the plastics want to move freely but they cannot like you canmot while your arms are spread. reheating plastics is like releasing your neighbour's hands and running to the center of the former circle. neither the kids nor the plastics have shrunken - they just got back to their natural state. the molecules of the plastics are so small, that you cannot see, what they do, so you wrongly thaught, that heat shrinks plastics.\n\nReese_Tora\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nIn general, heat causes things to expand.\n\nIn special cases, materials that shrink with heat have some sort of structure with gaps in it, when heat is applied to these, the structures are weakened and can collapse.\n\nFor instance, Ice has a crystalline structure that causes it to expand as the ice freezes. When the ice melts, that structure collapses, and it contracts again as it reverts to water.\n\ngenerally speaking, only solids should be able to shrink with hear, liquids and gasses should always expand with hear and contract with cold (unless there's some sort of chemical reaction going on, but that's another thing all together)\n\nbaggier\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nTwo main things can happen to plastics when you heat them\n\nthey can decompose - losing wight and thus volume - usually need temperatures over 200 C for this\n\nThey can change shape but not volume - however this can appear like it it is shrinking but is just an illusion. Take shrinkwrap. It has been stretched in two dimensions when hot then cooled freezing in the stretch. When you heat the shrinkwrap around an object, the heat softens the polymer, allowing to contract back to where it wants to be. The lengths of the shrinkwrap contracts, but this is balanced exactly by an increase in thickness which you dont notice. Its a bit like when you stretch a rubber band, the volume of the band stays the same even though one of the lengths is increasing.\n\n \n24\nRank by size \nr/sousvide\nOne of the more informative steak videos I've seen: Why Ripping Hot Is Too Hot? | TESTED\nyoutube\n128 upvotes · 43 comments\nr/Physics\nPBS Space Time - What if Gravity is not Quantum\nyoutube\n354 upvotes · 66 comments\nr/todayilearned\nTIL: The Prionailurus rubiginosus or \"Rusty Spotted Cat\" is the world's smallest cat.
