Typically made out of plant-based materials, often agricultural byproducts. You might see biodegradable and compostable straws in your local restaurant or coffee shop and you can buy these drinking straws for your own use. With so many types of biodegradable and compostable straws on the market, it's important to know the difference between biodegradable and compostable straws so you can choose which option best fits your eco-friendly lifestyle. Here's what we'll go over in this guide:\n\n\n\n\nTable of contents\n\nAre compostable straws biodegradable?\nHow long does it take biodegradable straws to break down?\nTypes of biodegradable straws\n8 best biodegradable straws you should switch to\nTop 5 FAQs about biodegradable straws\n\n\n\nBefore we get into the different types of biodegradable drinking straws, let's discuss compostable straws and if they are biodegradable products. We'll also talk about how long it takes these biodegradable straws to break down.\n\n\n\nAre compostable straws biodegradable? \n\n\n\nMany eco-friendly straws are labeled compostable, biodegradable, or both. Biodegradable simply means that the straw will break down over an unspecified amount of time. Technically, any material is biodegradable over time and depends on the environment. Compostable materials must degrade into a nutrient-rich substance at a certain rate.\n\nFor straws to be considered compostable, they need to be certified compostable. This means they are made of organic materials. Biodegradable straws simply refer to any material that breaks down and degrades in the environment.\n\n\n\nHow long does it take biodegradable straws to break down?\n\n\n\nMost things are considered biodegradable, even plastic. Often companies will use biodegradable plastics or bioplastics instead of petroleum-based plastic for their products. Biodegradable straws take anywhere from a few months to a few years to break down, depending on the materials used to create them.\n\nBreaking down biodegradable straws doesn’t have to be complicated or even take years. Using an electric composter, like Lomi, is a quick and easy way to turn food scraps and Lomi-approved biodegradable materials into nutrient-rich fertilizer for your plants in as little as 4 hours.\n\n \n\nLomi\n\n★★★★★\n\nLomi allows you to turn food waste into plant-ready nutrients in under 24 hours. Boost your plants while reducing your waste.\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\n \n\nTypes of biodegradable straws\n\nAs more companies move to be more green, there are many new types of biodegradable products available. We're no longer limited to just flimsy paper straws that will fall apart while stirring cold beverages. Here are some of the different kinds of biodegradable straws you can buy.\n\nPaper straws: Paper straws are probably the most common biodegradable drinking straw you'll find. Paper is material from renewable resources and it degrades easily and fast, but can sometimes get soggy quickly. \nBamboo straws: Bamboo straws are highly sustainable, have good antibacterial properties, don't bend, and can be easily composted at the end of life. You can wash and reuse them for a while before having to toss them in the compost bin.\nWheat straws: Wheat straws are made from wheat stems. This material is usually treated as waste so converting this ‘waste’ into straws allows for saving natural resources.\nSugarcane straws: Just like wheat straws, sugarcane straws are made from agricultural byproducts. Sugarcane straws hold up to both hot and cold beverages.\nPLA straws:  PLA straws are often made out of corn plastic- a non-petroleum material made by converting corn into resin. PLA straws require industrial composting conditions and are not home-compostable.\nAgave straws: Agave fiber drinking straws are made of agave stems as the byproduct of tequila production.\n\n\n\n \n\n50+ Easy Tips to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint\n\nDownload this FREE resource to find and incorporate small changes to your daily routines that can make a positive difference to the planet!\n\nFREE DOWNLOAD\n\n\n\n \n\n8 best biodegradable straws you should switch to\n\nNow that you know the different types of biodegradable straws out there, let's look at some of the most eco-friendly, biodegradable, and compostable straws you should switch to in order to kick plastic straws to the curb. \n\n\n\n1.

No need for additional manufacturing like some other biodegradable straws.\n\nWhy we love these straws: Wheat straws are made from the stems of the wheat plant after the grain is harvested.

That's why we've gathered up some common questions about biodegradable straws to make things a little easier for you.\n\n\n\n1. Are plastic straws biodegradable?\n\n\n\nMost plastics are not biodegradable and cannot be broken down naturally by bacteria or other living things. Plastic straws will gradually disintegrate into smaller and smaller particles, known as microplastics, over a period of up to 200 years.\n\n\n\n2. Are PLA straws biodegradable?\n\nPLA bioplastic doesn't degrade as quickly as organic matter. It can take nearly as long as regular plastic to break down. PLA straws can be composted but this should be done in commercial compost facilities to ensure ideal conditions.\n\n\n\n3. Are paper straws biodegradable? \n\nPaper straws are fully biodegradable and compostable. They will begin to break down in about 2-6 weeks. Even if they wind up in the ocean, they’ll begin to break down in as little as three days.\n\n\n\n4. Are agave straws biodegradable? \n\nBecause agave straws are made of organic materials, they can be consumed by microorganisms and will fully biodegrade in normal landfill conditions in about one-to-five years.\n\n\n\n5. Are bamboo straws biodegradable?\n\nBamboo straws are biodegradable, but the time it takes bamboo straws to biodegrade depends on the type and the environment. Also, if additives were used during the process of manufacturing, it can take longer for them to biodegrade than bamboo straws without additives.\n\n \n\nWhen it's time to dispose of your biodegradable and compostable straws, you can send them to a commercial composting facility if a curbside collection is available in your area. If curbside composting isn't an option, home composting, like using a Lomi electric composter, is recommended. Lomi can turn your biodegradable and compostable straws into nutrient-rich dirt that will help fertilize your plants. Users love how Lomi composting helps divert waste from landfills and nourishes their plants. \n\nWhichever option you choose, any of these products will be a better choice for you and the planet than the plastic alternatives. We hope this helped make it easier to choose your next eco-friendly straw.\n\n\n\n\nWritten by: Sarah Kendal\n\n\n\n\n \n\nWant to Live More Sustainably?\n\nJoin our growing community of 200,000+ subscribers for tips on sustainable living, gardening, composting, and more.
