I love listening to it while taking walks, traveling, doing work to concentrate and sometimes watch YouTube and movies.\n\nMy fret on the pros is that there are tons of people complaining on the comfort, the fit and the tips that make them fall off and minor issues and not to mention the price.\n\nMy fret on the new ones, they might be too big. It might hurt in the ear due to the plastic tip and there’s no ANC.\n\nI REEEEALLY want to experience Spatial Audio. Bonus if the Pros sale as the same price as the 3’s, but yeah, for me they’re still hefty. Which should I get?\n\nClosed • 338 total votes\n181\nAirPods Pro\n157\nAirPods 3\nVoting closed 2 years ago\nhomedepot.com\nLearn More\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\nneedfulluyten\n•\n2 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 1 yr. ago\n\nAirpods Pro. Better all-around, 30% off too. Highly recommend Comply ear tips, made a massive difference in comfort + they really stay in my ears now.\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\nthrowthegarbageaway\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nHey man, I found your thread through google and I just wanted to chime in with my personal experience.\n\nSo first of all, I HATE rubber tip headphones. They sound like crap, they sound like my head is inside a box, I feel claustrophobic, and to top it all off, they never stay in my ears and they hurt after a couple hours of use. I’ve tried TONS of them, I had beats IEMs when I was young and dumb, I had sennheiser IEMs (by far the most comfortable ones out of the bunch, but still a pain), I’ve even had god damn Apple IEMs (bet ya you didn’t know about these)\n\nSo having set the stage, my friend lent me their Airpods pro for a day to try out. They were the most comfortable and plush fit I’ve ever worn. The sound stage felt open, and the transparency mode sounded acceptable (which is leagues above any other transparency mode I’ve tried yet), and I literally forgot I had them on after just 5 minutes of wearing them.\n\nSo my point is, don’t make the wrong decision based on the potential discomfort or fit issues of rubber tips, you might be very surprised.\n\nThat said, I’m personally leaning towards the new ones, because of the better lost mode tracking and better microphones (I use them heavily for long phone calls, so mic quality is very important to me)\n\nI think you should try them both out and figure it out for yourself. Remember Apple has a pretty good return policy.\n\nReply\nreply\norganist101\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nThank you. We don’t really have an official apple store here in our country just trusted licensed resellers. Idk bout the comfort really because sticking a silicone bud in my ear is a little irritating like taking them off and on and moving them. It’s like I’m cleaning my ear or something. I really do hope they’re what you’ve stated. I’m mostly after the ANC because I want to shut chatter noises as well and noise pollution.\n\nI guess just the comfort of the newer ones is you put them on and BAM. You’re in business. And they’re cheaper. This is really a hard decision for me since they’re both pricey\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\n1 more reply\nbutterbuts\n•\n2 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 2 yr. ago\n\nMy wife gave an early Christmas present 2 weeks ago in the form of AirPods 2. I loved the ease of use between my iPhone and iPad (I’m new to apple, coming from android). I had 2 issues with them though\n\nThey were faulty with some crackling issues\n\nthey hurt my ears due to their hard plastic design poking the cartridge in my ears (mainly my right ear).\n\nI took them back to where I purchased them and decided to pay the difference and get the pros (price matched Amazon and they beat the price by 5%). Man, the difference is night and day. Pros are much more comfortable and are just better in every way.\n\nI was kind of lucky in that my mum had the pros so I could try before I decided to change, but Pros anyday of the week to me. I don’t have an issue with the battery on the Pro so extra isn’t a feature I need (like on the 3’s) and while I don’t use ANC often, I like having the option there.\n\nThe difference in price was $20 so the pros were a no brainer.\n\nReply\nreply\nTheloniousPhunk\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nLate to the party here so I’m not sure if you made your purchase or not yet, but there are two main factors to consider about your purchase: Ear feel and ANC (active noise-cancelling). The actual monitors themselves are identical, so the base sound quality is the same between both pairs.\n\nGen 3 pods are classic earbud in style, with no in-ear tips. Pros are your in-ear rubber-feel tips. Some people swear by each style respectively. Personally I find that while sound quality feels a bit better with in-ear tips, the earplug-feel of them makes me feel almost claustrophobic and it gets uncomfortable very fast. You also have to clean the tips regularly and replace them after a certain amount of time. On the other hand, they will offer a tailored fit to your ear and will enclose your audio experience and help further block outside noise. It comes down to personal preference on this matter.\n\nNext up is ANC, active noise-cancelling. This is where your AirPods will emit a range of frequencies that block outside noise and allows a more ‘soundproof’ style of listening. Personally, I can’t stand ANC - the frequencies played very obviously interfere with the quality of your audio output (this is more noticeable for people with a ‘trained ear’ such as musicians or studio technicians.). However some people very much prefer ANC as it blocks all outside noise. One benefit is that if you are listening to music or talking on the phone in a noisy environment it will help considerably.\n\nFor me, because I prefer non-rubber-tips and I can’t stand ANC; the gen 3s we’re the obvious choice.\n\nReply\nreply\n11 more replies\nletraz\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nPro, with other ear tip\n\nReply\nreply\nIntoTheMirror\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI find silicon tips really uncomfortable. Luckily, you can get a myriad of different foam tips for them that are a lot more comfortable. Like from Dekoni or Comply.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nbigbootyguy\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nOrdered both. As much as I enjoy pro. They hurt my right ear bones. Also. My call receivers notice my voice is worse and they hear more outdoor noise during calls from pro. I sound way better with 3.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nBeanye\n•\n2 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 2 yr. ago\n\nPro by far. Not sure how people prefer having their ear holding onto hard plastic over soft tips.\n\nEveryone's ear is different so if your ear doesn't like the 3s then you're stuck where as you can get a multitude of tips to find something that works for you with the Pros.\n\nReply\nreply\nZD_plguy17\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI made switch from airpords 3 to Airpords Pro (1st gen). I can say this I perceived sound quality little better on regular airpords but they hold into my ear well, most noticably wider soundstage. But I prefer Airpods Pro for smooth fit and sealing so I can hear more details and less distraction from noise outside.\n\nEither Airpods are more comfortable than most IEMs from chi-fi especially when it comes with out of the box silicon tips. My most recent wired IEMs don't fit well my with medium tips that fell loose nor big that were too big and hurt my ear canals. Had to get for these custom foam plugs. The Airpods just work well out of the box.\n\nReply\nreply\nPuzzleheaded-Crow-74\n•\n9 mo. ago\n\nBy far? Seriously? You can’t just speak for yourself and then generalize it. My girlfriend has the pros and I have the 3rd ones and I can tell you that the 3rd gen Airpods are more pleasing to listen to, sounds more dynamic with better soundstage. The pros also get your ears all sweaty and the tips all waxy, a problem that you don’t have with the 3s. The only benefit the pros offer is the ANC and that’s pretty much it.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nTOP POSTS\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of October 26, 2021\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of October 2021\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2021"
