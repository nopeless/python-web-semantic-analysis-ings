We need entirely new modes of production and distribution because what we do now is killing the planet.\n\nReply\nreply\nRednaxila\n•\n3 mo. ago\nCitvej\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nWhere do I research more about alternative models?\n\nReply\nreply\n7 more replies\n47 more replies\nm2thek\n•\n3 mo. ago\n•\nEdited 3 mo. ago\n\nI really don't think it's that big of an ask for:\n\nRestaurants to stop giving out straws by default\n\nPeople who know they want/need straws to be expected to carry one with them when they're out\n\nPeople who don't need straws to survive without them\n\nRestaurants to carry a very small amount of disposable straws in the event someone who absolutely needs one does not have one\n\nReply\nreply\nKes1980\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nThis does not mean paper straws are as bad as plastic ones. If you throw away a paper straw with a thin coating of something water repellent, most of it would still biodegrade, where plastic doesn't.\n\nReply\nreply\nZoso03\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nYup, it was never addressed, and this article is bad for not addressing it. Enough people hate paper straws, and this will add fuel to that fire without giving proper perspective\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nWhenVioletsTurnGrey\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nIf I've learned anything it's that \"Saying you are doing a good thing is much more impactful than actually doing it\" , as far as most business is concerned.\n\nReply\nreply\nJosh-Rogan_\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nBan the f*cking things. Nobody needs to use disposable straws.\n\nReply\nreply\nCowBoyDanIndie\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nIt’s hilarious how much people focus on straws. There are much much larger sources of single use plastic. It was downright hilarious when starbucks changed their single use plastic cups so they didn’t need a straw…. Worrying about straws is either penny wise pound foolish or just virtue signaling. You should see how many pounds of plastic get used to pack and ship all the crap we consume. Palettes get wrapped in layers of plastic that just gets thrown out on delivery.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nswagdu69eme\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nWhy are people so insanely focused on straws? Are you aware that not using your car for a day or eating no meat one in a while will have way more impact than using disposable straws ever will?\n\nThis is greenwashing by companies to make you think they did something for the environment by switching to shitty paper straws, and everyone's eating it up.\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\n24 more replies\nFX_King_2021\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nAnd I was buying only paper straws thinking its eco-friendly.\n\nReply\nreply\nConscious-Shoe-4234\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nif, in a world of f250 dualie trucks you purchase a bicycle: \"they strip mined the earth for the aluminum in that frame\" is not an argument ever made in good faith.\n\nReply\nreply\nKowzorz\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nThere are few ways to interact with this capitalist machine that are truly eco-friendly anymore, between manufacturing, product transportation, the retail sale of it, your transportation of the purchased (by package or car), and then the eventual disposal of this probably-meant-to-be-landfilled object.\n\nThere are gradations, of course. Recycling your pizza box is less harmful than landfilling it. But there's still all the other factors that went into that product too. Few products avoid most of these abuses and still play the capitalist game.\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nGreenMirage\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nI used a hollowed out Goat rib bone from my curry meal when I was 9. My family threw it out saying it was degenerate and rural despite the fact we slaughtered the goat ourselves. 😆\n\n🤷 ivory > bone > titanium > steel imho for that eco-friendly drip.\n\nReply\nreply\nheloguy1234\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nWhy are we still using this shit in single use items? Common sense isn’t going to solve this problem. We need regulation.\n\nReply\nreply\nSea_Comedian_3941\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nWhy TF do you need a straw, and if you do, they should be reusable.\n\nReply\nreply\nerikmongabay\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nMetal straw user here, don't like how the paper ones melt in your mouth anyhow...\n\nReply\nreply\nFrozenFern\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nSeems like every solution ends up being its own problem a year later. At this point we need to just go back to homesteading or feudalism for 200 years and reset. Give nature time to bounce back\n\nReply\nreply\nspamowsky\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nIs this truly shocking?\n\nReply\nreply\nView more comments\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/environment\nPaper straws not so eco-friendly, 90% contain toxic “forever chemicals”\nnewatlas\n1K upvotes · 135 comments\nr/environment\nPlants are better for Planet Earth than scientists thought.
