This is how you add air to your plants layer effectively controlling the intencity.\n\nOr you can use the spray tool.(but soulsands is way more uniform)\n\nReply\nreply\nNick-Urban\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nTook my a couple reads to understand but I understand now - thank you! :)\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n \nTop 6%\nRank by size \nr/factorio\nIs there any way to make pollution more nuanced?\n7 upvotes · 12 comments\nr/Unity3D\nHow do layers and culling masks work?\nself.Unity3D\n14 upvotes · 3 comments\nr/hlvrai\nHL2VRAI BEGINS DEC. 16TH\nyoutube\n149 upvotes · 38 comments\nr/LEMMiNO\nThe Backpacker Who Vanished\nyoutube\n203 upvotes · 56 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nThis TRANSPARENT ENGINE is Fascinating (How Engines Work) - Smarter Every Day 292\nyoutube\n203 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/LightNoFireHelloGames\nLight No Fire Announcement Trailer\nyoutube\n345 upvotes · 74 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
