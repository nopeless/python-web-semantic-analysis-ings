A plastic grocery bag stretched under the cap usually works pretty well. Or you could just buy another kazoo - preferably one with a water resistant resonator.",

I played it for so long I got exhausted. But after like an hour of playing, the sound was getting a bit weak. I thought it was covered in spit so I washed it out with water and dried it out with paper and tried playing it again. No sound at all. I had NO idea there was a piece of paper in my kazoo that was needed to make the noise. Now the paper is wet. I've waited for it to dry for hours but nothing is happening. Will my kazoo recover or do I need to switch out the paper somehow?\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nkazoobie\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nIf it's a cheap, imported kazoo, the resonator (that little piece of paper) is probably cellophane and may or may not recover from being wet.

I mailed the company and I'm going to get a metal one instead with removable turret\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 19%\nRank by size \nr/Netherlands\nWhy Vienna's housing is so affordable compared to Amsterdam?\nyoutube\n153 upvotes · 171 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nTrapping 200 Scammers in an Impossible Maze [22:31]\nyoutube\n152 upvotes · 12 comments\nr/eurovision\nBlanca Paloma - Jaleo (Spain 2023)\nyoutube\n106 upvotes · 15 comments\nr/Cynicalbrit\nGeekenders - Jesse and Dodger RETURN!\nyoutube\n110 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nMCU Defenders of The Status Quo [21:58]\nyoutube\n116 upvotes · 42 comments\nr/Cynicalbrit\nThis makes me happy\nyoutube\n182 upvotes · 19 comments\nr/hellblade\nNew Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Trailer\nyoutube\n297 upvotes · 48 comments\nr/eurovision\nLahjakäärijä - \"The gift wrapper\"\nyoutube\n95 upvotes · 10 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nThis TRANSPARENT ENGINE is Fascinating (How Engines Work) - Smarter Every Day 292\nyoutube\n203 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/TheHague\nThe destruction of the Hague during WW-II in color\nyoutube\n108 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
