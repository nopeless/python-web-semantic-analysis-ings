Even still, their traditional material has increasingly become known as a primary source of harm to the environment. Plastic straws are heartbreakingly found in the stomachs of sea animals and are responsible for clogging precious marine ecosystems. \n\nThe good news? Paper straws can provide an eco-friendly alternative to their plastic counterparts. The debate of paper straws vs plastic straws has been raised time and time again among environmental enthusiasts. Which materials can save the earth, and do paper straws really make a difference? Let’s discuss whether you should switch from using plastic straws to paper straws.\n\nWhy Are Plastic Straws Bad For The Environment?\n\nPlastic straws are one of the world's most commonly used and thrown-away items. Devastatingly, their convenience comes with a heavy price to our planet. \n\nOn average, 500 million plastic straws are discarded daily in the US alone! Not only do plastic straws take hundreds of years to decompose, but their production and disposal continue to have damaging effects on our environment. \n\nThe manufacturing of plastic straws requires non-renewable resources such as oil, natural gas, and harmful chemicals that dramatically pollute water sources and as a dire consequence, therefore increase their carbon footprint.\n\nAs if that weren’t enough to change your mind, saddening statistics show the disposal or littering of these single-use straws results in them being washed away into oceans where marine life may consume or become entangled in them. \n\nThey can even break down into smaller pieces that accumulate over time and harm wildlife further by breaking and entering into their food chain. A chink in our armor is discovered as we come to the realization that the harmful chemicals intoxicating the fish you intend to eat will then be transferred to you.\n\n Source: Internet\n\n>> Read More:\n\nWhat Is Climate Change: Causes, Impact on Humans and Animals\nWhat is Net Zero: Importance, Roles of Individuals and Organizations\nWhy Are Paper Straws Better Than Plastic Straws?\n\nPaper straws vs. plastic straws is a hot topic of discussion and controversy that has continued for some time now. But why do most people think paper straws are superior to the popular and widely used plastic ones? The answer lies in the two materials' sustainability levels and how they affect our environment. \n\nFirst of all, paper straws are signific more biodegradable than their plastic counterparts. They break down easily and quickly, reducing their impact on the environment significantly. While plastic is made from non-renewable resources and can decompose for up to 500 years, paper straws can break down in less than three months when exposed to sunlight or water.\n\nThe second advantage of using paper over plastic is its safety level for animals and marine life. The danger of plastic stems from its ability to be ingested by animals, once it has broken into tiny pieces or has accumulated in the large masses we now find in our oceans called ‘plastic islands’.  This is not a conceivable issue when discussing paper straws.\n\nAnother benefit of using paper over plastic is its health factor and side effects. Studies have deduced that chemicals from plastic straws can leach into drinks and be ingested by humans - something you don’t have to even consider with a paper version.\n\nDo Paper Straws Really Make A Difference?\n\nAs the world moves steadily towards more sustainable practices and eco-friendly options, paper straws have become increasingly popular as a replacement for plastic straws. Paper straws are made of biodegradable material, aiding to reduce plastic pollution in the environment. While they do serve as an alternative to single-use plastic products, these paper products do come with some disadvantages. \n\nPaper straws can quickly become soggy and difficult to use, making them unsuitable for many long-lasting beverages, such as smoothies or milkshakes. Furthermore, paper straws are not durable, and users may have to go through them multiple times a day if using them for extended periods of time! \n\nPaper straw is the most common green alternative to plastic straws, but in fact is not the greenest - its contradiction is that it has some negative impacts on the environment! The increasing prevalence of paper straws has been the catalyst to surmounting and concerning environmental consequences: the destruction of forests. Paper straws are created through a process that requires destroying trees for their material, meaning fewer trees are available to absorb carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, contributing to global warming. \n\nThe production process for paper straws is highly resource and energy-intensive and damaging to the environment. The logging industry continues to harvest more trees, leading to soil erosion, loss of animal habitats, air pollution from trucks transporting wood pulp, and toxins released from machinery used in production facilities. This increases carbon emissions overall as they enter our atmosphere due to this high energy consumption.\n\nAs climate change worsens and resources become scarcer, it’s important to consider the full environmental consequences of our actions – even something as seemingly inconsequential as choosing paper over plastic straws.\n\nSource: Internet\n\n>> Read More:\n\nWhat Are Paper Straws?
