  "body": "If Caeser joined the Straw hats all of the show's credibility is immediately gone. I do think he will joins Buggy's crew however, because he is a comic relief character who will probably remain in the story, is an idiot, and thematically fits Buggy's crew. Also the clowns could use a heavy hitter now that Buggy is a warlord.",

He already has a crew. He also admires the SHs too much, if he became one he would die lol.\n\nBut I do think he will become a strong ally to the SHs.\n\n8 more replies\nCha_Lad\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nAs much as I love Rooster-kun I really don't want to see him joining the Straw Hats. I just think it wouldn't suit his character. If he is part of the crew it wouldn't make sense to fanboy anymore. Also he doesn't seem to have the same childhood dream that the rest of the crew has. His determination only has comedic value and no serious plot development.\n\n3 more replies\nwoah_take_it_ez_man\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nI hope he stays as a recurring character. Crew or not.\n\n1 more reply\nbWoofles\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nEveryone in the straw hats has a dream to accomplish his goal is to be a straw hat so that doesn't work.... But what if he follows the straw hats around like Luffy never asks him to join but he follows them any way so he ends up being a mock crew member\n\nXenyme\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nEverything would fit better if he didn't join and stayed as an important ally. He wouldn't be with them all the time, but when he did meet them, he could keep his fanboy personality.\n\nThey need another fighter to add on to the monster trio. But to be honest, I don't think there is currently any character we know that would be good enough. They need to be strong and have a good sense of humor like all the other crew.\n\nMelting_Orphan\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nWhy the hell is everyone getting downvoted? I upvoted everything to make it fair.\n\n1 more reply\nQwardian\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nRobin does already have a nic name for him, like she does every other member of the SH but Luffy... But at the same time she has a nic name for Kyros. Which is someone I really want to join. I have a feeling he has only shown a fraction of what he is capable of.\n\nrodriw\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nI don't think so, but i'd will like him on the crew\n\nAnshin\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nIf Bartolomeo joins them I'll eat a straw hat\n\nWhiteBoyChief\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\n\"Do you think Barto will be the next crew member\" would have been a better title.\n\ndarexinfinity\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nHe'll probably be offered to join by Luffy but for some reason he won't.\n\nmarquize\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nHe won't, Luffy won't have him. Sure Luffy wants respect from his crew, but I doubt he wants to be idolized by them, remember how insulted he felt when Fishman Island treated them like heroes? He doesn't want that.\n\nRoronoa_Zoro_\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nFor those who doubt there will be new members please do yourself a favor and read an interview with Oda himself (the author):\n\nhttp://opforum.net/showthread.php?tid=6501\n\n1 more reply\nView more comments\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/OnePiece\nOne Piece and The NFL's Los Angeles Rams will have a collaboration on December 3rd!\ninstagram\n305 upvotes · 70 comments\nr/Dandadan\nAnime announcement\nyoutube\n1.1K upvotes · 113 comments\nr/OnePunchMan\n[OC] Nameless insect Monster Sculpt Timelapse\nyoutube\n141 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/BlueLock\nBlue Lock: Episode Nagi, New Trailer!\nyoutube\n112 upvotes · 18 comments\nr/hajimenoippo\nTotally Not Mark Reviews Hajime no Ippo: East Japan Rookie Tournament\nyoutube\n255 upvotes · 61 comments\nr/OnePiece\nSPOILER\nOne Piece: Chapter 1100 - Theories and Discussion\n127 upvotes · 515 comments\nr/OnePiece\nSPOILER\nOne Piece: Chapter 1099 - Theories and Discussion\n127 upvotes · 315 comments\nr/dragonball\nDragon Ball: Sparking!
