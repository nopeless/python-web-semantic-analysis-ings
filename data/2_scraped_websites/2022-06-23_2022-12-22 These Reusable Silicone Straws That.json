Not great for sodas, they tend to fizz like crazy going through the straw, but for everything else they're amazing. I use them for smoothies in specific since I can then open them and make sure to get out all of the teeny tiny seeds.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nLow key thought that was pasta for a second. That's really smart though!\n\nReply\nreply\nThe-Fumbler\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nMy fat ass thought it was spaghetti\n\nReply\nreply\nEmily_Postal\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI don’t like silicone straws because they’re too flexible. They don’t work well with the plastic tops with the x holes. They collapse like it’s a hose with a kink in it. I prefer the steel ones.\n\nReply\nreply\nFkn_stress_rxn\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI don't like metal bc they have a weird taste to me (maybe psychological). I've had that problem too, but these work well since they have to be thick for the Zipper\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nglittery_grandma\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI have these and love them. I used single use plastic straws before as a way to drink more that wasn’t a sensory nightmare and then when they were banned here (which I still stand by being a short sighted decision) I was just pretty dehydrated for a while. I have multiple disabilities and these straws let me see inside them so I know they’re clean which was a fear of mine when trusting others to (very kindly) wash up my straws. They’re great. I got mine from Amazon.\n\nReply\nreply\nFkn_stress_rxn\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI like that I can chew them like a plastic straw 🙃\n\nI hate the feel of metal. I love my glass Straws too, but I always want to bite them lol\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nJordanGrace24\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nWHOAHHH. This is pretty neat\n\nReply\nreply\ncumberber\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nDoes anyone have a link to purchase these\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\ntenkohime\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI thought someone would post a brand name or shop link. I like the idea of it.\n\nReply\nreply\nFkn_stress_rxn\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThe brand is \"SqueakyCleanStraw\". I don't have a link, I found them on the clearance rack.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nBlackbear0101\n•\n1 yr. ago\n \nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
