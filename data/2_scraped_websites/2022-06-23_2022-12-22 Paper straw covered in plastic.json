Sure, this is one thing right and 5 things wrong, but all things considered it's still better than having a plastic straw. Well plastic straws are usually wrapped in paper.",

No business cares about environment. For example, you can't find a single paper straw in my whole country, only because people more concerned about cost of the product rather than environment-friendliness\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\nTinder4Boomers\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nNestle is death incarnate\n\nReply\nreply\nkaylinnic\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI love the asterisk after “with paper straw”.
