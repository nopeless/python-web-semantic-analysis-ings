You can get them to do all sorts of wierd stuff including throwing them around somones head. The spin is the key I'm not sure about this flick nonsense, as we never experimented with it and I'm not sure how you would add a flick without throwing off the straw. But what we were doing was putting the straws as far down our palm as we could. So to the crook of our thumb so we could hold it upside down if need be and then a very plainer motion such that the straw was forced to spin down our palm put the spin on it. You could only move your hand in one direction or you mine as well have just knocked it off a table. Anyway the heavier the straw the better McDonald's seemed to be the best at the time. Heck with a stright downward motion we were able to throw a straw like 20 feet and watch it do 3 loops in the air.\n\nReply\nreply\n7 more replies\n3rt41\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nCool, now someone can tell me why is he putting a straw in a beer?\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\nUnorthodoxViking\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nI need this.\n\nReply\nreply\nstilt\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nWell, I'm about to waste a few hours of my life\n\nReply\nreply\nlucantini\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nThis probably has something to do with the Magnus Effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2OSrvzNW9FE\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nGreyhaven7\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nI'm not sure who made this gif without a watermark.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nBuSpocky\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=781640718610177&id=386068331500753&_rdr\n\nReply\nreply\nItPutsLotionOnItSkin\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nI want to learn this but I'm too lazy\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nMy hand hurts from trying this...\n\nReply\nreply\nOneHalf_SafetyFactor\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nDid he just put a straw in a beer?\n\nReply\nreply\ntakkuso\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nRelevant conversation\n\nReply\nreply\naxehomeless\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nWhy is weird german music in the background of this gif?\n\nReply\nreply\nbuzzkills68\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n\nPls teach me master\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\nâ€¢\n8 yr. ago\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/Lostwave\nThe Filthy Frank Kenya Song has been found\nyoutube\n320 upvotes Â· 45 comments\nr/guitarlessons\nThe CAGED system for guitar explained - 90 minute lesson on the CAGED system\nyoutube\n136 upvotes Â· 13 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
