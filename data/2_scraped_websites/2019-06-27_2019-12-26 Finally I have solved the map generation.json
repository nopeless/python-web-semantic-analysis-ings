In fact, this happen on the Save/Load Mode too, but when you load the game a second time during the same session at RW, the game will continue normally! This happen even if you load the same save that the first time has given to you the \"empty map bug\". The saves are not corrupted... they are still there, and they work perfectly.\n\nThis obviously wasn't possible with Permadeath because when you have that map, the only 3 options are \"save the game and go to menu\", \"save the game and exit from RW\", and these obviously overwrite your game with the empty map, or your can press Alt+F4, but when you will restart RW, the bug will be there another time (when it starts to happen, it literally happens every time you load that save).\n\nIt was so simple! I don't care about Permadeath anymore, and to live the same kind of experience, I usually keep loading the last saved game without bothering with the past ones.\n\nDo you think I should make a request in the Bug Section on Ludeon Studios to solve permanently this bug?\n\nRead more\nArchived post.
