Physics Planning and Designing lab.\n✔ Answered\n\nAim: To determine the internal radius of a drinking straw.\n\nApparatus: measuring cylinder, beaker, drinking straw, ruler, water\n\nMy teacher instructed our class to use these set apparatus to assist us in the lab. I am currently stomped on how to do this. I believe I am able to use more materials, excluding a micrometer gauge.\n\nAnybody able to assist me or give me an example on how to go about this lab?
