Download it today.\n\nTake the No Straw Please Pledge\n\nThe Plastic Pollution Coalition and The Last Plastic Straw have created a social media campaign, inspired by the turtle video, including new videos of people pledging to refuse plastic straws.  Please help to spread the word through your social media channels.\n\nTake the Pledge Here.\n\nShare PPC’s latest No Straw Please video and watch their Facebook page for new videos in the coming weeks.\n\nHere’s a sample tweet:\n\nJoin Trevor to sign the pledge to Refuse Plastic Straws: No Straw Pledge #RefusePlasticStraws #plasticpollutes https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfFV0gExc6w&feature=youtu.be\n\nAnd are some sample Facebook posts:\n\nTrevor, “I want to talk to you; it’s really important: Plastic Straws Endanger Sea Turtles.’ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfFV0gExc6w&feature=youtu.be Join the campaign.  Sign the pledge at: No Straw Pledge #RefusePlasticStraws @plasticpollutes\n\n“I want to help make this a better world and that involves not using plastic straws.” –Meirav, age 8. Share her video and take the pledge:https://www.facebook.com/PlasticPollution/videos/vb.173697869512/10153730862204513/?type=2&theater #RefusePlasticStraws\n\nExplore and share the resources on The Last Plastic Straw Website.\n\n Switch to Reusable Straws\n\n While drinking straws may be unnecessary for many people, those of us with sensitive teeth prefer to drink cold beverages through a straw.  Fortunately, there are reusable options like glass, stainless steel, bamboo, and hopefully soon, straws made of straw.  Bringing your own reusable straw can be a good strategy to get restaurant servers to remember not to put a straw in your drink.  “Look,” you can say.  “I have my own.”  Hopefully, the novelty of the reusable straw will jar them from their automatic habit of putting a straw in everyone’s drink.\n\nOther helpful straw-related posts you might enjoy:\n\nPlastic-Free Drinking Straws: Paper, Glass, and Stainless Steel\n\nInitiative: Getting Restaurants to Stop Giving Out Plastic Straws Automatically\n\nCarrying Our Own Containers: Powerful Action or Pointless Inconvenience?\n\nPlastic-Free Travel: Bring Your Own and Be Prepared\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nYou might also enjoy...\n\"Take Back The Filter\" takes on \"Bay to Breakers\"!\n\nWell, I put out the call, and Tanya and Christa volunteered to help me, dressed…\n\nI voted today!\n\nDidn't want to leave it to chance.
