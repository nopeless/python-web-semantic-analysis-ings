If it is sitting in the sun for a while, you can feel the static charge on it when you approach it, even if no one has been on it recently (so it's not just from friction of users' clothing).\n\nArchived post.

The plastic of the slides (and other, non-conductive materials) tend to build up spare electrons just from the air currents moving over them, so its not really the sun that makes them collect charge. As the air around the plastic heats up, it loses its density and humidity, meaning that electrons that were sitting on or close to the plastic get stuck there. Air flowing over the plastic deposit more electrons. As the air cools after the sun goes down (or if it gets cloudy enough), the air around the plastic becomes more dense and can hold more humidity, which means that the electrons can be carried away by stray ions faster, and the amount of excess charge decreases.\n\nThe same kind of thing happens to aircraft windows, just a lot more air is flying past so more electrons build up. Fighter craft have special conductors attached to their cockpit windows (which are a type of plastic) to help remove excess charge, but they still have to be wiped down when they land before the pilot can exit because arcs (like little lightning bolts) can occur (we learned this the hard way, no deaths that I'm aware of, but injuries and damages).\n\n3 more replies\n \n24\nRank by size \nr/todayilearned\nTIL: The Prionailurus rubiginosus or \"Rusty Spotted Cat\" is the world's smallest cat.
