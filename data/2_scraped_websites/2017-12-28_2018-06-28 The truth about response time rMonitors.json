This should be one of the last specs that concerns you. Response time is purely a marketing term that has insignificant effects in the real world due to modern monitors have acceptable response times anyways. There are other factors that are more important when buying a monitor. For more info, check out the monitor buying guide in the r/buildapc wiki.\n\nWhat is response time?\n\nResponse time is the time it takes for a pixel to change from 1 color to another. This measurement is the time it takes (in milliseconds) for a pixel to change from 1 shade grey to another shade of grey. Why grey? Because this has the fastest response time as opposed to switching from blue to green, or 2 other non-grey colors. This allows monitor manufacturers to market a low response time. However, in actual use, your monitor is not switching only between 2 shades of grey...\n\nArchived post.

My PG279Q averages around 5-6ms on Normal overdrive. I can push it to about 4ms with Extreme but with lots of overshoot errors, however that 1-2ms of difference is very noticeable to me. I would love to see 1ms. It's just a shame that speed is tied with shitty TN panels which I refuse to ever use again.\n\nPolishRoulette\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nIt's definitely an important metric, and one you shouldn't ignore. G2G times can definitely be misleading.\n\ngypsygib\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nResponse time matters, it's just all of the transitions not just grey to grey that do. As well as overshoot.\n\nAnd not all modern monitors have acceptable response times for gaming. If you don't game on your monitor, then yes, response time won't matter too much.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nTerrible post.\n\nResponse time DO matter\n\nGo compare a decent TN panel next to an equivalent IPS or VA version..\n\nyou'll notice that IPS and VA panel have much more motion blur than the Tn panel does.\n\n4 more replies\nheckels\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nTFT central normally has good review of actual response time plus input lag to see how \"fast\" a monitor actually is. They also test real contrast ratios instead of the inflated ones the companies use.\n\nScoopDat\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nI got something worse...\n\nHDR. Till we see 12-bit panels, with 1000 or more nits of brightness, avoid HDR as a selling point like the plague.\n\n4 more replies\nCoalscence7\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nThe only marketing gimmick in regards to response time is when companies say \"1ms response time\" and it refers to MPRT (moving picture response time ).\n\nkahmos\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nUnless you play fighting games\n\nwhatevernuke\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nI thought this was fairly common knowledge, but I've seen some people fall into this trap. I wonder if anyone's done any blind tests to see at what point people can clearly identify slower response rates.\n\n2 more replies\nNautisop\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nResponse time is one of the last things i look at. Rlly, all these subs way overestimate the impact of rt. Everything under ~12 ms is ok and you won't get ANY better in a fast 1st Person shooter only because you have 1ms. Most \"normal\" people who look in the sub aren't monitor enthusiasts, they Look for a good monitor and not one which eliminates all these phantom smyptoms. It's like a normal guy searching in an Audio sub but Finds himself sorrounded by audiophiles.\n\nmerloki\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nResponse time and refresh rate are the most important variables for a gaming monitor. The 1060 6GB or RX 580 8GB can easily hit 130 FPS in Ultra settings on a 1080p display (for example in Overwatch). Why would you go for an extremely slow 60hz IPS 5ms GTG (= 14 ms typical response time and maximum response times above 25ms) and still have ghosting and blurring even on a very low refresh rate like 60Hz? I mean, 144Hz 1ms TN monitors with great brightness and great colors have become very affordable. For example a MG278Q TN panel has 1ms response time and better image quality than the more expensive MG279Q IPS version. If you have an IPS panel you will be lagging behind gamers who use TN so you will have a significant disadvantage. Response time is actually the most important monitor specification for competitive gaming. IPS panels also have a significantly less consistent production quality than TN panels. This means that IPS panels have very high return rates and this causes even more pollution because the panel needs to be produced twice.\n\nIs it worth playing the IPS lottery any further? (I've returned 6 monitors so far) https://www.reddit.com/r/Monitors/comments/72fpk5/is_it_worth_playing_the_ips_lottery_any_further/?st=jebfre39&sh=069acc0d\n\n095179005\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nThis is precisely why we can't use \"response time\".\n\nextremely slow 60hz IPS 5ms GTG (= 14 ms typical response time and maximum response times above 25ms)\n\nHow does 5 = 14?\n\nLike most people, you confused response time with input lag.\n\nResponse time is pixel response time.\n\nInput lag is input delay.\n\nMotion blur is because of the sample-and-hold technique of our eyes, and is largely based on refresh rate and if you use strobing.\n\nAlso, 1ms response does not guarantee the best image. Manufacturers cherrypick and inflate the numbers by using excessive pixel overdrive, leading to overshoot ghosting.\n\ncc u/MikeNotBrick\n\n2 more replies\nklrpwnzsmtms\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nResponse times DO matter. It's just fucking marketing teams with their \"OMG 1MS RESPONSE TIME\" bullshit misleading most people.\n\nDepending on transition, response times always differ and can reach 8-10ms for those \"1ms\" TN panels if overdrive isn't tuned properly.\nThe most hilarious part is when some Samsung claim 1ms response time for their bullshit SVA panels which in fact can have some crazy 25-30ms response times for 0->255 (black to white) transitions.\n\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/Amd\nAMD Presents: Advancing AI\nyoutube\n186 upvotes · 114 comments\nr/Amd\nCan Integrated Radeon 780M RDNA 3 Graphics Beat The GTX 1050 Ti?
