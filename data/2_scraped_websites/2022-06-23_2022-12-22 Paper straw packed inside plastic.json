You can guarantee that they would get plenty of similar complaints about it being unhygienic if they packaged it in anything else.\n\n2 more replies\nRuniat\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nJust to check, is there a way to tell it's plastic rather than cellophane at a glance or did you take it to a laboratory to find out?\n\nnifer317\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nWow.

The plastic wrapper acts as a barrier against dirt or other contaminants for the straw inside. Wrapping the paper straw in plastic is still less plastic than wrapping a plastic straw. Those cups as well are recycled paper.\n\nWhat would you have them do?\n\n9 more replies\nYoguls\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nI don't get why they provide a straw at all, who drinks coffee through a straw?
