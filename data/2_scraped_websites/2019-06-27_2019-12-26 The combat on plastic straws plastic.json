Every day copious amounts of product comes in boxes that contain at least 1 plastic bag per item, sometimes the items will be bagged in individual plastic and then put into another bag. I'm at a low volume store and we easily have 3 6ftx6ftx3ft bags of plastic every day, I cannot imagine what higher volumes have. We should be posting pictures of the high usage of plastics in retail stores, even the more \"progressive\" stores use a lot of plastic. Sorry, even your reusable straws come in in plastic bags. We need to target the problem as a whole, instead of making a fad out of it.\n\nArchived post.
