It then takes them and puts them into a directory as .strm files and also displays them to the screen. You can use Kodi to open the files and watch the streams (use Videos -> Files -> setup the dir you want/browse the dir)\n\nRead the file for prerequisites in the file.\n\nLinux bash script: https://pastebin.com/WHZiGUw0\n\nThe next Windows PowerShell script drops files in C:\\VMS (quite by accident, change this if you want) and displays them to the screen. You must install or upgrade PowerShell.
