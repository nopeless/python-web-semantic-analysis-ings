  "body": "It's still cutting down on waste if you use them over and over. But if you want to get away from plastic all together better to get something like a silicon or glass or metal straw. Edit—read your comment too quickly pre coffee, thought you meant plastic straws couldn't be reusable 🤦‍♀️. But leaving up in case it's helpful.",

What's the scoop?\n\nI already have stainless steel reusable straws so I really don't need one, but was curious.\n\nwalgreens.com\nLearn More\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nShoreMama\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nIt’s a big/fat red straw wrapped in clear plastic. It looks like it should be for a milkshake but they are supposed to be reusable for any drink. They don’t look particularly reusable to me, but yes we are selling them and you have an option to get one instead of the throw away ones.\n\nReply\nreply\nHWTechGuy\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThank you for the reply.\n\nReply\nreply\nkillerewok76\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nI mean, they are made of plastic like any straw you get from a tumbler. What doesn’t seem reusable about it?\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nGutBustingFaceMelter\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nI’m happy more companies are offering these and thus got one to be supportive even tho I have a Final Straw at home that I love. As the other commenter said, it’s just a big, red harder plastic straw. Very easy to reuse if you just wash it out, but it’s not like, a super high quality one. Probably best to just use around the house for a couple of months, I would guess is it’s lifespan.\n\nReply\nreply\ndiet_potato\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nI think something that isn't being shouted out is how convenient it is for like other take out cups. Its very tall, so that's super nice. Its also a good, affordable introduction to the concept for people who may not have tried them otherwise.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n \nTop 4%\nRank by size \nRelated\nWawa\nConvenience store\nPetroleum industry\nEnergy Sector\nBusiness\nBusiness, Economics, and Finance\nforward\nback\nr/Lostwave\nThe Filthy Frank Kenya Song has been found\nyoutube\n322 upvotes · 45 comments\nr/greenday\nDilemma (Official Music Video)\nyoutube\n419 upvotes · 90 comments\nr/AmazonDSPDrivers\nVlogger fired from Amazon after documenting a week as an Amazon delivery driver\nyoutube\n190 upvotes · 119 comments\nr/youtubedrama\nOz's fundraiser livestream\nyoutube\n160 upvotes · 57 comments\nr/DirtyDave\nMoney Guy Show Made a Short Referencing Dave Ramsey's 8% Withdrawal Rate\nyoutube\n116 upvotes · 90 comments\nr/youtubedrama\nThe Completionist’s Open Hand Charity Scam Has To Be Investigated...\nyoutube\n104 upvotes · 28 comments\nr/greenday\nGreen Day's 2023 Grey Cup Halftime Show is now up on their official YouTube page\nyoutube\n183 upvotes · 55 comments\nr/mac\nThe impact of 8gb vs 16gb measured\nyoutube\n323 upvotes · 311 comments\nr/HostileArchitecture\nNYC is Building Anti-Homeless Streets…\nyoutube\n361 upvotes · 78 comments\nr/poppunkers\nGreen Day - Dilemma (New)\nyoutube\n142 upvotes · 56 comments\nr/poppunkers\nOpinion: The Last Song by The All-American Rejects is a pop/pop-punk masterpiece!\nyoutube\n118 upvotes · 27 comments\nr/poppunkers\nNeck Deep - We need more bricks\nyoutube\n141 upvotes · 60 comments\nr/flipperzero\nFinally, FlipperPhone!
