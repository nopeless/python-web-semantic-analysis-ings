I asked this question in r/environment and someone referred me here. Please let me know if my question could receive better answers somewhere else, or if it has been answered already! :-)\n\nI am an avid drinking straw lover, but I am an environment lover more. I am making the switch to reusable straws, but I have a whole package of unused plastic straws in my kitchen.\n\nWhat is the best way to get rid of them? I don’t want to just throw them away because obviously that’s not helping the cause but is that the only option I have? Kind of a “these are the last straws I’ll ever throw away so whatever” type deal? Or is there a better way to get rid of them?\n\nAlso, I’m not interested in repurposing them for DIY stuff. There’s too many of them and frankly, I just don’t have the time/energy to repurpose them. Plus they’ll just get thrown away eventually.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!!\n\nArchived post.

Just make sure they are disposed of properly.\n\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nThat depends on your city's waste management system.
