From pseudo devil worshipers to doomsday cults killing their children, if nothing else is evident people kill people for all kinds of reasons. We've seen police cover-ups before, we've seen really bad evidence collection before, we've seen police tamper with evidence and lie on the stand. Seems to me nothing the defense is emerging in this case especially with the pictures of the In Oden We Trust patches on prison guards uniforms and some guards admitting they're Norse pagan religious ties and some having actual ties to Odenism that none of what the defense is allegeding is really all that far fetched. There were a couple aspects of the filing that maybe were a little contradicted by some evidence, but you could say that about the states case too, if they actually have one. The evidence so far has been week to say the least. Can't believe they even filed charges with what they have (at least what we're aware of because courts still being super secretive with evidence so far, even though it's supposed to be working in the public interest, doesn't seem to me that's the ultimate goal so far). Just saying at this point, I think there is a least some evidence to support that it's possible, enough for reasonable doubt.\n\nView full post\nu/AutoModerator\n‚Ä¢\n23 days ago\nGeneral Discussion Thread - for all quick questions, observations, and discussion of shorter topics. | Thread sorted by new\nMegaThread\n\nIf you have a random or short theory, question, thought, or observation, this is the thread for that.

An alternative theory:\nTheories\n\nWhile the defense‚Äôs investigative angle was certainly warranted, I don‚Äôt believe the murderers of these girls were part of a specific Odinistic group. I do however believe the sticks found at the scene covering the girls bodies were runes along with the rune on the tree. I also believe the individual responsible for these killings has a strong background with runes and Norse culture. HOW they were first introduced and acquired knowledge of runic languages differs though.\n\nPer the Purdue professor after viewing the pattern of sticks on the girls ‚Äúit was a given‚Äù that someone was trying to replicate a Germanic runic script. A Harvard professor with even more knowledge on runes was also in agreement with the professor. The FBI BAU also concluded the killer would be familiar with Norse culture. I completely concur with these three expert opinions above.\n\nThe defense took these runes found at the scene and constructed a scenario of the type of runes exhibited and a set of individuals who practice Odinism as having possible involvement in these crimes. However, in my opinion the witnesses on the trails at a critical timeframes and locations do NOT support the involvement of these individuals.\n\nIn the prior defense memorandum the public learns for the first time which witnesses were responsible for the development of the two sketches. I have long believed that a specific 19-20 yr old with curly hair was involved in these murders and was pleasantly surprised to hear that the bridge witness responsible for the YBG sketch not only described an individual as such, but placed him on the bridge at a critical juncture inside three minutes of the girls arrival to the bridge.\n\nHer sketch was developed on 2/17/17 just four days after the murders. She views the individual from 50 ft away with an unimpeded view and describes him to the sketch artist as such:\n\nWhite male, 20 years old, curly brown hair, medium build. When the sketch artist requests her opinion on the sketch, she replies: ‚Äú10 out of 10.‚Äù (page 105 of the memorandum.)\n\nI firmly believe she witnessed the killer. The Task Force, in their 2019 Change in Direction press conference said as much when they stated: ‚ÄúThese are two separate individuals‚Äù and we believe the YBG sketch ‚Äúis a better representation of the man on the bridge who IS responsible for these murders.‚Äù\n\nI also believe this 19-20 yr old had intimate knowledge of the trails and surroundings, along with the means, motive, opportunity, background and psychopathy to commit this bizarre ritualistic type of crime. The runes at the scene only further reinforced my beliefs.\n\nHow did the killer come to know runes? This 19-20 yr old individual had an enormous ‚Äúfan boy‚Äù fascination with everything Tolkien. As widely known, the Tolkiens works, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were heavily influenced by Nordic culture and contained runes throughout both. Tolkien even described Gandalf as his ‚ÄúOdinic Wanderer.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúWhatever are runes? \" ~ Bilbo Baggins, The Hobbit\n\nThe Runic alphabet was a system of writing, a set of letters with angular shapes that could easily be carved into wood or stone. Its origins and usage were mainly in Northern Europe by the Norse tribes and Anglo-Saxons. Tolkien had a love for words, languages and the powers they evoked through the characters, symbols, and meanings behind them. His Oxford studies were in the ancient Germanic languages. Tolkien utilized the real world Anglo-Saxon writing system called the futhorc and Germanic runic alphabet, the futhark, in the Hobbit. He later created his own runic language called the Cirth in the Lord of the Rings along with several other runic languages utilized secretly by the dwarves and elves.\n\nThis 19-20 yr old I believe responsible grew up in a highly religious, insular environment. He‚Äôs intelligent, well versed in a multitude of arts, technologically savvy, strong youth org background, military trained, a master destractor, and con-artist with an expansive fantasy life.\n\nFrom an early age he was ingracetied with the magical, mythological world of Tolkien and likened himself as the ‚ÄúSheriff of the Shire‚Äù or an Ent in the forest. This imaginative, creative, grandiose self and world is saturated throughout his life. Real life to him was just way too boring. Couple that with collections of ceremonial weaponry and unconventional religious beliefs. Believe the location above all was of importance to the killer for multiple reasons. The girls were merely resolutions towards those motives. Motives aren‚Äôt necessarily singular in nature.\n\nAdditionally believe the blood rune left on the tree is not the Odin, Ansuz rune but rather the Fehu wealth rune or Cirth, (g) rune. Both the Fehu and the Cirth (g) runes appear similar in either runic alphabet as an F with upturned arms. It‚Äôs the killers way of commemorating the event, marking his territory, his presence, his kill. We can see a similar marking in the Hobbit where Gandalf carves the same F shaped rune into Bilbo Baggins door. This rune symbolized to the dwarves where they can find Bilbo Baggins, their, ‚ÄúBurglar for Hire.‚Äù\n\nThis unusual and unique usage of various runic languages in this individual‚Äôs life was communicated to the Task Force, along with example, in 3/23/21 and again in 7/12/23. Most individuals familiar with runes utilize them at either a symbolic or cursory character level. This individual differs though. He actually utilizes runes as a full runic language. To illustrate picture an individual writing a lengthy poem or religious passage but in a runic language.\n\nTo date it‚Äôs unknown if Richard Allen is involved. The 9/18/23 memorandum posed many concerns. The two lead detectives depositions implied, Richard Allen and Richard Allen alone. Yet behind close doors they state otherwise. Justice for the girls, families and community is only realized when the correct individual(s), whomever they be, are all accounted for. I believe this 19-20 year old the witness described on the bridge is the killer and is responsible for both the runes and posing at the scene.\n\nSide note regarding possible additional accomplice: (The witness responsible for the OGS sketch who described seeing a muddy individual walking on 300 N is a very strong resemblance to the 19-20 yr old‚Äôs mentor who was 39-40 at the time of the murders and sported red/brown hair, mustache/goatee, non blue eyes, 220, approx 6‚Äô0 and had a strong penchant for short billed hats.) Both YGS and OGS would have motive. The young individual moved out of state after the murders. Both currently live out of state.\n\n(The above are my opinions only and should not be interpreted as fact.)\n\nView full post\nu/AutoModerator\n‚Ä¢\n1 mo. ago\nGeneral Discussion Thread - for all quick questions, observations, and discussion of shorter topics. | Thread sorted by new\nMegaThread\n\nIf you have a random or short theory, question, thought, or observation, this is the thread for that.
