Before I insert the straw, I take the lid off and bend the little teeth that hold the straw down so they’re not squishing the straw. It’s usually one or two teeth that get bent and since the straw isn’t squished at the half point, it doesn’t rip up there.\n\nbozeke\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nIt’s always the lid. Also: why are we insisting on paper straws but keeping usually non recyclable plastic for the cups and lids? It’s idiotic.\n\nAnd while I’m at it: do we really need lids for our cups ALL of the time? I get that sometimes it is usefu especially with kids, or when driving, and etc., but it is so weird that it has become the default.\n\n202 more replies\n30 more replies\nGreat_Heavens99\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nAre u fighting with da straw?\n\nYontoryuu\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nIf he was, I wonder what was the last straw that pushed him to do it.\n\n8 more replies\nxbubblegum_bitch\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nwhat da straw doing?\n\n6 more replies\n10 more replies\nStereotypicalNerd666\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nMotherfucker are you eating the straw\n\n35 more replies\nSelectionAshamed7566\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nHow the fuck do you drink your smoothie?
