Also making the product cheaper to produce.\n\nReply\nreply\nWiscoAstro\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nBlack for sure. I guess technically gray because you’ll just use less black colorant.\n\nVivid or bold yellows are also very expensive and difficult to manage since heavy metals are not allowed in colorants anymore.\n\nReply\nreply\nbazamaphone\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nNatural. Aka no colorant added.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nptc075\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nMost plastics start in a tan or beige color (although a few are clear). So in theory, uncolored should be your cheapest. But black is usually done with carbon black, which is very cheap as well. I've never heard of it reducing the price below the natural color however.\n\nOn the expensive side, it comes down to colors that need to overwhelm the basic color. So if your material is dark tan naturally, making it bright white (or bright pink) requires a lot of pigment.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 12%\nRank by size \nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
