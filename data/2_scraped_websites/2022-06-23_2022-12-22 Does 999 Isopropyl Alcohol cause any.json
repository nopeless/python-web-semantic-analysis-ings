Since I have a bottle of isopropanol in my medicine cabinet that is sold in plastic it doesn’t automatically kill all plastic, but since not all plastic is the same I’m sure it interacts poorly with at least one kind\n\nReply\nreply\nOk_Abbreviations4687\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nwell in my instance its plastics used on an Electric Razor, tried to dig up some manual stating what plastics they used, but couldn't find anything.\n\nReply\nreply\nEntity2358\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nIsopropyl alcohol (C₃H₈O) will damage plastics at 90.0%-91.0%, so 99.9% isopropyl alcohol will definitely corrode plastics.\n\nIt just depends on the type of plastic, C₃H₈O doesn't corrode all plastics. It also doesn't usually happen upon contact, and usually takes time.\n\nReply\nreply\nFun-Corner-5850\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nNot 100% Sure but Hdpe should ne Safe shouldnt it?\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nTylerdirtyn\n•\n1 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 1 yr. ago\n\nIso is safe on PP but can degrade PET but not plain destroy it. All plastics are different, this is not a universal thing.\n\nNaphtha is safe on pp5 but want to know what will degrade it? Liquids with a ph above 13. Basic Liquids can slowly eat a paint bucket but paint thinner or even gasoline won't do any damage. Gasoline can dissolve a plastic condiment bottle in minutes. Gas cans have been made from hdpe for a couple decades now although I still have a couple old steel cans in my mom's garage.\n\nAll plastics are different. The statement \"Isopropyl destroys plastics above 91% concentration\" is only a quarter truth, misleading and incorrect.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nreflUX_cAtalyst\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nLook at the table and find out\n\nReply\nreply\nTylerdirtyn\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nDepends on the plastic. True story these guys on a very popular website told a user to clean his true HEPA filter on his flowhood with bleach, chlorine bleach destroys the bonds in polypropylene so he killed his 800 dollar air filter. Most plastic products made today have a small stamp somewhere on them that indicates what type of plastic it is. You need to find what type of plastic you are working with and use a chemical resistance chart to determine the suitability of a given chemical (In this case Isopropyl alcohol). Under normal circumstances people with access to 99.9% already know these things (where did you buy 99.9% iso and what is the application? They sell 91 over the counter and 99 at grow stores but I have never seen 99.9% unless I dried it myself with magnesium sulfate.)\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nRelated\nChemistry\nPhysical science\nNatural science\nScience\nforward\nback\nr/buildapc\nMaking sure isopropyl alcohol (for cleaning my PC) has no additives?\n2 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/Python\nWhat the Heck Are Monads?!\nyoutube\n131 upvotes · 53 comments\nr/3Dprinting\nWhy IPA (per se)?\n7 upvotes · 42 comments\nr/Netherlands\nWhy Vienna's housing is so affordable compared to Amsterdam?\nyoutube\n153 upvotes · 173 comments\nr/Physics\nPBS Space Time - What if Gravity is not Quantum\nyoutube\n354 upvotes · 66 comments\nr/cpp\nMy entire C++ Game Programming university course (Fall 2023) is now available for free on YouTube.
