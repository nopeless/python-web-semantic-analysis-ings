  "body": "Here's one that has a similar aesthetic.. The creator of this one has a bunch on the workshop all in a similar pixel art style, with a bit more focus on a Japanese-y vibe.. If you search for top rated all time, and then select abstract as the genre, you'll find quite a few others I'm sure.

Awesome work!\n\nReply\nreply\nLennSan\n•\n7 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 7 yr. ago\n\nBest I can do is 2240x1085 (also at 15 fps instead of 24, but it still looks good), here it is: http://imgur.com/a/FD06Y\n\nAlso, if someone wants to put it on Wallpaper Engine (I can't do it myself because I don't have the program), you have my permission to submit it. If you do, please message me before you submit it. Here's a bonus 1920x930 version if that's better: http://imgur.com/a/D0D3K\n\nEDIT: Forgot to set both of those gifs to loop endlessly, here are the looping versions:\n\n1920x930: http://imgur.com/a/zsmj9\n\n2240x1085: http://imgur.com/a/gOtvO\n\nReply\nreply\n6 more replies\nStereojunkie\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nLook for wallpaper engine on steam\n\nReply\nreply\n8 more replies\n8 more replies\ngvbn10\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nIncredible piece of art\n\nReply\nreply\nLennSan\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThank you!\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nbe4u4get\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nLeaves from the vine\n\nFalling so slow\n\nLike fragile tiny shells\n\nDrifting in the foam\n\nLittle soldier boy\n\nCome marching home\n\nBrave soldier boy\n\nComes marching home\n\nReply\nreply\nLennSan\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\n:'(\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nDude not right now.

However, the area below the trees doesn't show the train at all? Plus, that one pixel that changes doesn't change back for a bit longer than it seemingly should. Then again, I'm not the one who made it. Perhaps there's something obstructing the train.\n\nRegardless, this is very beautiful. I just thought I'd give some feedback. Wonderful work!\n\nEdit: Looked it over and realized the ground below the train lines up just before it even would show any of the bottom of train. My bad! Still confused about the top one though. (I think I'm getting a little too into this, bah (I apologize))\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nBleghel\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nthought you'd like to see this OP, made a desktop with it, thanks for the awesome gif :>\n\nReply\nreply\nVayes\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nWater effect is gorgeous.\n\nCan't say that I like the pulsing Sun though :c\n\nReply\nreply\nIn-China\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThe white sky and red sun reminds me of the smoggy pollution mornings of Beijing. The pollution would be so thick that you can stare at the sun, which turns into a red-orange disc.\n\nReply\nreply\nnonight\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nLovely animation and colours!\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nView more comments\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nRelated\nArt\nPixel art\nArt\nforward\nback\nr/godot\nI Did it, Every Single Godot Node Explained in 42 Minutes!
