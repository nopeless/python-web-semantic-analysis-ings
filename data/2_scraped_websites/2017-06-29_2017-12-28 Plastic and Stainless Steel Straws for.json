These RTIC metal straws are fantastic. They don't lose form and the beverage tastes better than with a plastic straw and the ice cold feeling of the metal straw as you are drinking feels refreshing\n Share \n' Share Review by GEORGE B. on 26 Aug 2023\nWas This Review Helpful?  0  0\nH\nHugh W.\nVerified Buyer\n5.0 star rating\nType:\nStainless Steel\n08/26/23\nThis product sucks!
