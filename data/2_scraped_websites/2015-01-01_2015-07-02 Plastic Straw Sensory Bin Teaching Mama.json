Usually we use beans, rice, or sand for a sensory bin filler. This time we used plastic drinking straws! It was easy, cheap, and colorful.\n\nMy Latest Videos\nSkip ad\n0 of 15 secondsVolume 0%\nThis ad will end in 2\n¬†\n\nAll you need for this activity are colorful plastic drinking straws and a bin. I found a HUGE bag on clearance at Target (for around $2). I also gave my preschoolers kid-friendly scissors, rope for threading, cups, and tongs.\n\nJust running¬†your hand through the bin is fun! It feels neat¬†and it makes a unique¬†sound.\n\nEven my 6 month old got in on the fun! He loved splashing his hands in the straws. It was his first sensory bin experience. Since he doesn‚Äôt sit on his own, he sat in my lap and I tipped the bin up so he could¬†reach the straws. He loved it!!\n\nMy three year old enjoyed threading the straws on the rope. To prepare¬†the rope, I tied one end in a knot and the other end I burned with a lighter (ahead of time!) so it wouldn‚Äôt fray.\n\nThis was great practice for fine motor skills!\n\nHe loved creating his necklace‚Ä¶then he turned it into a headband! He cracks me up! üôÇ\n\nMy 5 year old really enjoyed cutting the straws with scissors. I gave him a bunch of long straws to cut into smaller pieces. He thought it was the greatest thing ever!\n\nMy 3 year old tried cutting straws, but it was difficult for him. I remember Troy having a hard time with scissors at this age, so it‚Äôs awesome to see Troy using scissors so well now.\n\nWe also had fun poking the straw pieces together to make ‚Äúlightsabers‚Äù (as my kids would call them!).\n\nAs you can see, there are different ways to play with this sensory bin. These were just a few ways we played with it, but there are other ways we can still try out! We‚Äôre keeping this one out in the playroom for more fun play!\n\nThis was day 23 of the 31 Days of Play Series.
