As a person that's been playing for a few months (I can get to diamond but not mythic) I don't really see the justification for why it's included.\n\nIt's 3 mana deal 1 to a player or planeswalker... or 3 mana draw 1.\n\nI've played a bunch of games against opponents that use it and I either kill them before they can use the planeswalker a second time or they don't have enough creatures to protect it from my attacks.\n\nWhat are your opinions? Should the card be included or are there better options ?\n\nView full post\nu/MajorStainz\n‚Ä¢\n14 hr. ago\nI won 2 festival in a box tourneys on arena, am I getting 2 festivals?\nQuestion\nu/rickraus\n‚Ä¢\n16 hr. ago\nI did it!

Just think of ALL the different conditions, abilities, enchantments, etc. that go into a game like MTG and imagine having to write those as code and actually make them work as intended. MTG video games are nothing new. In fact, I believe the first game came out around 1997ish While many of their video games were not too similar to the paperback experience, Games like MTGO and Arena are.\n\nMy point is, I have to give credit where it is due. Game Developers rarely see positive feedback because most feedback is negative as is human nature. Therefore, I would like to extend my thanks to the actual developers of these games. Not the marketers or publishers. The developers.\n\nThank you for your hard work.\n\nView full post\nu/dupue\n‚Ä¢\n25 min. ago\nHow do I get the Baldur's Gate Avatars?\nQuestion\n\nI am a returning player after 3 years break, and I see people with Baldur's gate avatars.
