My personal favorite is the dark green.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nthefragile7393\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI think I’ve seen these at some Asian markets near me...now I need to go look and hopefully get one to try\n\nReply\nreply\nitachinehan\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nGreat pic and I like it too!\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\neuca9527\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nti love this brand.they make right tea drink\n\nReply\nreply\nyogurtraisin\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nMy local ramen shop sells these in the US! They’re really delicious and refreshing and they’re the only bottle tea that I can find that doesn’t have anything else like sugar added.\n\nReply\nreply\nrbmako69\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI used to buy Oi Ocho green tea all the time. I would buy it by the case. Then one day I went to open a bottle from a new package, and noticed it was slightly different. Didn't think anything of it, took a drink and spit it out, like it was spoiled or something. Upon further investigation, this particular bottle and all the bottle in my case were not made Japan, but Taiwan. So I chalked it up to my local store being cheap and ordering a lower quality product. So I returned the case, and ordered from Amazon, and the same thing. I was unable to find the OG Japanese made product, and stopped drinking it.\n\nAfter a bit a research, nothing official, it appears that ALL Oi Ocha made for export is made in Taiwan now, so unless it you can get it directly from Japan while you are there, you will only find the inferior product, at least in the US.\n\nNo if you've never had the OG Japanese made one and only the Taiwanese made one, you have nothing to compare it against, and you will probably have a better experience than I did, but unless i can find the OG stuff I'll never drink it again.\n\nReply\nreply\ngoatsgivemelife\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThat's a beautiful bottle. So spring-y😊\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\ndelanvital\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nAny love for a Scandinavian addicted to this? I've had no luck. My wife also love it. Has to be that specifically.\n\nReply\nreply\nmenholdingfish\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nIts really sad how in the last ten years the market in Asia for bottled tea has sky rocketed. Its no where near as good as real tea. You have no connection with the leaf. Everything has to be quick and convienient at the cost of taste and tonnes and tonnes of plastic pollution. Each to their own\n\nReply\nreply\nAndrew_Brew\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI'm kinda agree with you, while being in japan, I visited some tea farms, and they all say that the bottled tea industry is destroying the prices and the quality and makes it very difficult to prospere as a little farmer, so in the last year A LOT of tea farms closed in Shizuoka.\n\nReply\nreply\nKangarooJesus\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI personally think drinks like this can be delish, but yeah, the production of this sort of stuff is definitely a net loss by far. For society and for the Earth.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nsensible_human\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nReally? I thought this particular brand of bottled tea (Oi Ocha) tastes amazing, and tastes closer to fresh green tea than any other bottled tea out there. But besides this brand, I agree with you. Especially the plastic waste.\n\nReply\nreply\npham_nuwen_\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThis kind of thing is also pushing the small tea producers out of business. Soon the only Japanese green tea left will be the lowest quality mass produced, pesticide rich, but cheap and predictable bottle friendly tea. Say goodbye to hundreds of years of tradition and amazing flavor in favor of convenience.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n2 more replies\nyeahjusso\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nLive on that stuff when I’m in Japan\n\nReply\nreply\nsensible_human\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI live in Philadelphia and have these all the time. Our local Asian grocery store stocks them. If I was in Japan, I would probably have them even more often.\n\nReply\nreply\n6 more replies\nPistonMilk\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI drink this brand at work.
