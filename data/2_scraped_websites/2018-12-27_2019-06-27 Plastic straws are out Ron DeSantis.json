That's a real first step in tackling the gargantuan problem of plastic production. I don't understand why republicans love disposable plastic so much.",

This means that cities like St Pete can continue to ban plastic straws, and makes me very confused as someone who hated his campaign.\n\nReply\nreply\n7 more replies\nthebigt7575\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nClear your cookies.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nonly_because_I_can\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nAs someone who regularly picks up trash from the Hillsborough River, I'd like to see something done here. I pick up many, many straws. Biggest issue is still plastic bottles as far as what I see.\n\nAlso unsettling is the recent increase I've seen in medical waste (bandages, gauze, small bags, surgical gloves, etc.), especially as I get closer to Seddon Channel. Hmmmm.\n\nReply\nreply\nanon1984\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nOne issue with plastic straws in particular is that the shape makes them especially dangerous to wildlife. They get stuck in nostrils and ingested, clogging up intestines leading to a slow painful death. All plastic garbage is bad, but straws are fairly easy to replace with paper which dissolves quickly in water. I think we will se a lot more regulation of one time use plastics, particularly plastic bags which also are very dangerous to wildlife, in the coming years.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\ncometkeeper00\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThis is the worst title I’ve read.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nIs he...not actually that bad? I can be brave enough to admit I would have preferred Gillum but I appreciate this move.\n\nReply\nreply\ndontreadtogood\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nSeems pretty genuine when it comes to environmental issues, but still seems ass backwards on social issues, education in particular.\n\nReply\nreply\n15 more replies\nMedajor\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nYay!

I don't love everything about him, not even close, but he's done some things from a point of view he did NOT campaign on, and I'm good with that. Environment being one of those issues.\n\nReply\nreply\nsaren42\n•\n5 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 5 yr. ago\n\nAlright, cool, I mean, not a big surprise he wouldn't mind saying fuck you to people that actually need to use disposable plastic straws for consuming beverages in public. There are many types of disabilities that require that, and this is literally just putting more labor on them when they try to go out in those cities with the bans, which are literally just self-congratulatory bullshit. How about if we wanna address the littering and plastic, we address the corporate problem, which is where majority of the pollution and litter comes from in the damn world. This is some peak liberalism bullcrap here, all the people supporting this decision... seriously, think it out.\n\nReply\nreply\nADHDengineer\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nWho needs to use disposable straws? If you have a medical condition, it’s on you to provide your tools. I’ve never heard diabetics bitch that there aren’t free syringes at restaurants.\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nTampaSunset\n•\n5 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 5 yr. ago\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nRelated\nTampa\nHillsborough County\nFlorida\nUnited States of America\nNorth America\nPlace\nforward\nback\nr/funny\nSign placed by Captain Obvious\n581 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/florida\nMissing mother of 4 found dead in husband's storage unit: Police\nnewsweek\n253 upvotes · 38 comments\nr/politics\nTrump's attacks on vote-by-mail may have cost Sarasota Republicans\nheraldtribune\n188 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/florida\nAs expected, Rockstar completely nails Florida with the GTA6 trailer.\nyoutube\n620 upvotes · 147 comments\nr/StLouis\nHot Ones with Sterling K.
