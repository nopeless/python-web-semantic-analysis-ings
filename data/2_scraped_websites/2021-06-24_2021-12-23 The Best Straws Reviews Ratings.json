Simply stick the straw into your drink and sip away.\n\nWhen deciding on straws to buy for your home, think about which type of straw you prefer. Plastic has long been the standard, but in recent years, we’ve learned how harmful plastic can be for the environment. Still, if you only use a straw occasionally or you’re buying for a large party, disposable plastic straws are among the most affordable.\n\nFor all other uses, there are some great plastic straw alternatives. One is the paper straw. Completely biodegradable and attractive, these straws can be bought in bulk to save money. Plus, you’ll have the peace of mind of knowing your straw won’t harm the environment as you’re tossing it in the wastebasket.\n\nAnd perhaps the easiest and eco-friendliest option for home use is a reusable straw. You can find reusable straws made of various materials including silicone and stainless steel. Between uses, simply clean, dry and store. Some even come with brushes that you can use to make sure the interior of your straw is thoroughly scrubbed and ready for use again.\n\nOur Picks For The Top Straws\nView All Recommendations \nPRODUCT OVERVIEW\nOUR TAKE\n Top Pick\n\nComfy Package\nBiodegradable Paper Straws, 200-Count\nCheck Price\n\nWith a wide range of bright colors in each package, these fun straws are 7.7 inches long.

This set also includes a carrying pouch t...\n\nGreat for Gatherings\nThis package has 16 reusable stainless steel straws in a variety of sizes and styles, plus four brushes.\n\nWhat to Look For\nIf you’ve ever used a paper straw, you know they can be a little flimsy. Look for one that uses food-safe ink and top-quality paper to ensure it won’t become soggy between the first and last sip.\nStainless steel helps liquid retain its chilly temperature as it passes through. However, some find stainless steel straws to be less comfortable than straws made of other materials. For that reason, newer stainless steel straws feature silicone tips that provide a little extra cushioning while you sip.\nYou may not give much thought to the length of a straw when you’re being handed one in a restaurant. But when you buy your own, you should customize your straw to the height of the glass you typically use it in. Shorter straws are ideal for cocktail glasses, while you’ll need a longer straw for your bottled water, tumbler or tall drinking glass.\nThe size of the opening of a straw also matters. If you regularly drink smoothies or milkshakes, look for a straw that’s 10 millimeters in diameter, compared to the 8-millimeter size of a standard drinking straw.\nThe growing popularity of reusable straws has led people to look for ways to clean their straws. You can purchase a brush specifically for scrubbing reusable straws, though many reusable straws come with at least one brush. For best results, hold the straw under water and let the water run through as soon as you’re finished using it to make sure particles don’t get lodged in there. Then, run soapy water through and use the brush to thoroughly scrub it.\nIf your straw is dishwasher-friendly, you can toss it in, but your dishwasher likely won’t fully clean the interior of the straw nearly as well as your scrubbing brush will.\nStraw Rankings\n1.

The ban has forced some businesses to find a new way to send customers away with disposable drinks. Starbucks is perhaps the best example of this, with a recyclable lid that makes it easy to sip your favorite cold beverage without the use of a straw.\n\nBut when dining in, you’ll likely find that you’re left with a cup and no straw at all. That’s where a reusable straw can help. Some of these straws come with carrying bags, so you can keep one handy while on the go. If you’re eco-conscious, you might even decide to tell your server to skip the straw because you brought your own.\n\nLatest Reviews\nThe Best Pizza Stones for That Perfect Crust Every Time\nThe Best Honey Jars\n9 Best Dry Food Storage Containers\nThe Best Sous Vide Machines\nThe Best Coffee Grinders\nThe Best Milk Frothers\nThe Best Bag Clips\nBest Cookie Press\nThe Best Salt Rimmer\nCOPYRIGHT © THE E.W.
