Are the plastic ones gone for good? Or is there a possibility of asking for a plastic straw in the cafe?\n\nI find the paper straws extremely difficult to use and get any drink out of them, and then the drink makes it mush within ten minutes. So I'm left with over half a drink that I struggle to drink with a wet paper straw.\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nbettemidriff\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nJust buy a reusable straw and carry it with you. I do that .\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\noftbkk\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\ni mean you can ask for one but if you haven’t seen any in months they probably don’t have any. it could be because of shortages but i know starbucks was trying to go to paper straws. i would suggest buying yourself a reusable straw if you need a straw\n\nReply\nreply\nxoxlindsaay\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI usually have a pack of plastic straws or just order iced drinks that come with the \"sippy lids/nitro lids\", but totally forgot I was out of straws and ordered a frappuccino today.\n\nI didn't want to bother an already busy location over a straw either. Just wasn't sure if anyone had any insight on if paper straws was the new straw or if it was just a shortage issue.\n\nReply\nreply\njust_pig3on\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI'm a barista in michigan and we just recently got our plastic straws back because those paper ones always dissolve. Though our shorter straws are in really weird packaging and sometimes we don't even get shorter ones. The people here hated them from day 1 so maybe they'll bring them back for you guys in Ontario\n\nReply\nreply\nxoxlindsaay\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI hope so!\n\nI really can't stand the paper straws. And not a super big fan of reusable straws for a bunch of different reasons but also haven't found one that I actually like (texture wise and easily to drink out of).\n\nReply\nreply\nCaptKirk93\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nAs of the august 24 Starbucks Canada switched to paper straws some stores may still be using plastic as they use through old stock\n\nReply\nreply\nxoxlindsaay\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nOkay that's what I wasn't sure about, cause some stores seem to have it and then a block away the other store doesn't. And everyone is all so busy there that I don't want to make an issue by asking for a different straw type.\n\nReply\nreply\njcj44\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nPaper straws are the new standard, but plastic straws should be available on request\n\nReply\nreply\nToastyXD\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nNope. As far as I’m aware, I can’t even order plastic straws anymore (I’m also in Ontario).\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nRemind me not to visit Ontario without my own straws lmao\n\nBut seriously, no. I’m from California and we only have plastic straws. I think Starbucks is trying to move in the direction of paper straws though\n\nReply\nreply\nxoxlindsaay\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI am definitely a bigger fan of plastic straws over any other sort of straw, especially the flimsy paper straws!\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/unpopularopinion\nMost plastic thing that have been replaced by paper/wood are terrible\n7 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/starbucks\nStarbucks loses $11 billion in value amid boycotts\nnewsweek\n679 upvotes · 203 comments\nr/AMCsAList\nPaper Straws\n2 upvotes · 15 comments\nr/TheTryGuys\nTry Guys Test A Drunk Obstacle Course\nyoutube\n133 upvotes · 39 comments\nr/Mommit\nDoes a straw sippy cup THAT DOES NOT LEAK exist for babies??????\n14 upvotes · 20 comments\nr/TheTryGuys\nThe Try Guys Make Oreos Without A Recipe\nyoutube\n135 upvotes · 56 comments\nr/goodmythicalmorning\nWe're Done Trying\nyoutube\n129 upvotes · 63 comments\nr/goodmythicalmorning\n2500th Episode Celebration Special\nyoutube\n127 upvotes · 46 comments\nr/newbrunswickcanada\nCan I rant for a second?\n38 upvotes · 52 comments\nr/youtubedrama\nThe Completionist’s Open Hand Charity Scam Has To Be Investigated...\nyoutube\n104 upvotes · 28 comments\nr/cyprus\nIs there a place left in Cyprus where i can find plastic straws?\n7 comments\nr/bingingwithbabish\nBinging with Babish: The Every Burger from Rick and Morty\nyoutube\n149 upvotes · 29 comments\nr/Nalgene\nBuying Nalgene bottles off eBay, breaking them.\n5 upvotes · 8 comments\nr/starbucks\nDo you hate when customers bring personal cups?\n14 upvotes · 29 comments\nr/youtubedrama\nOz's fundraiser livestream\nyoutube\n160 upvotes · 57 comments\nr/bingingwithbabish\nBinging With Babish Eats His Last Meal\nyoutube\n458 upvotes · 21 comments\nr/Paramore\n“Somebody is getting fired!”\ntiktok\n241 upvotes · 32 comments\nr/BeautyGuruChatter\nNew Grooming Allegation Against James Charles\ntiktok\n430 upvotes · 93 comments\nr/porterrobinson\nThe instrumental for \"GTFO\" by Mariah Carey is literally just Goodbye To A World\nyoutube\n110 upvotes · 45 comments\nr/JennaGraceSnark\nGO OFF MATT😂🥰\ntiktok\n132 upvotes · 55 comments\nr/NoahKahan\nNoah Kahan in tears over his Grammy Nomination\ntiktok\n249 upvotes · 10 comments\nr/OliviaRodrigo\n'bad idea, right?' is featured in the new trailer of ‘ANYONE BUT YOU’ (2023)\nyoutube\n113 upvotes · 13 comments\nr/Vocaloid\nHatsune Miku wins the grand prize for the 2023 Japan Naming Award, which awards outstanding product names that contribute to life and culture.\nyoutube\n166 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/poppunkers\nOpinion: The Last Song by The All-American Rejects is a pop/pop-punk masterpiece!\nyoutube\n118 upvotes · 27 comments\nr/OliviaRodrigo\nOlivia Rodrigo - Can’t Catch Me Now (Official Music Video)\nyoutube\n122 upvotes · 17 comments\nTOP POSTS\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of September 16, 2021\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of September 2021\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2021"
