The size chart almost closely corresponds to the cargos for size M . I thought of getting them in size M , but again felt like they would be too \"large\" , so I went for the next lower size , not really sure how are they gonna fit but ðŸ¤ž\n\nReply\nreply\nr/IndianFashionAddicts\nâ€¢ Share your Black Friday purchases here\nNo_Pollution_7660 replied to chalta_hai 16 days ago \n\nWhat size did you order ?

I have observed many times that the music keeps playing when I pair then using NFC, also the play/pause doesn't work either when you pair it like that. Quick solution would be to turn then off anf manually turm them on or you could just turn off/on speak to chat.\n\nReply\nreply\nr/SonyHeadphones\nâ€¢ WH 1000XM4 - Not loud enough\nNo_Pollution_7660 commented 20 days ago \n\nDid you check within the app?
