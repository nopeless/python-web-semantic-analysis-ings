How easy would it be to penetrate human skin, for someone who has never stabbed anyone before? How about for the stomach? Just in case my stabbing arm is grabbed, I could just go for a quick stab to the stomach. How much force would it require? Please be as detailed as you can.\n\nI'm asking for self-defense purposes.\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nDarkninja39\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nWell...

If it's properly sharpened compare it to slicing a chicken breast with a filet knife...it doesn't take much. Stabbing? grab a pork shoulder and go to town.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago\n \nr/morbidquestions\nNSFW\nWhy is it so hard to find actually nice people in gore communities?\n395 upvotes · 259 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nNSFW\nIs there any videos of people doing those skyscraper stunts falling to their death?\n389 upvotes · 50 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nNSFW\nWhat’s a thought that can ruin someone’s life?\n320 upvotes · 252 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nNSFW\nPregnant and smoking pork videos?\n247 upvotes · 87 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nNSFW\nWhy aren't there more deaths in school shootings?\n232 upvotes · 53 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nThose of you who have OD’d on opioids, did you feel pain before you were resuscitated?\n200 upvotes · 39 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nDid Jeffery Epstein keep his girls well fed and taken care of on his island when they weren’t being abused?\n194 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nHow/why do presidents not get killed more often?\n152 upvotes · 48 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nWhat is the most vile/disgusting/evil thing you can imagine?\n126 upvotes · 121 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nNSFW\nWhat would happen to a person if it gets a tube sticked into its mouth and anus and then we pump air simultaniously from the two tube?\n124 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nWhat's the worst thing your chosen profession has required or forced you to do to another person who really didn't deserve it?\n114 upvotes · 25 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nWhat makes scary men so attractive?\n98 upvotes · 61 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nWhat’s the most horrifying/disturbing thing you can buy from Amazon?\n92 upvotes · 81 comments\nr/morbidquestions\nHow do they prevent suicidal people with very long hair from hanging themselves on it in psych ward?
