I started using resuable metal straws about a year ago because I was tired of buying new ones. Here's an article about the current trend in bars/restaurants ditching plastic straws\n\nhttp://imbibemagazine.com/bars-eliminating-plastic-straws/\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nHironoto\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nI would be concerned about material buildup on the inside of a reusable straw, especially if your bar uses thick/sugary drinks. Unless you have a way to either scrub or blast the inside of every straw, you're going to end up with layers of buildup on the inside. The heat of the dishwasher should kill bacteria,. but if the buildup gets bad enough, eventually a customer may get a tasty appetizer that he wasn't expecting.\n\nReply\nreply\n4 more replies\njonesey1955\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nPaper only, all the way. Renewable.\n\nReply\nreply\nRangerGundy\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nI make a lot of tiki drinks with the long super bendy straws so I still use plastic regularly, and for whatever reason I don't like drinking out of metal straws.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nFRO5TB1T3\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nI have really wide and thick plastic straws that i reuse with no problems, i even throw them in the dishwasher every once and awhile. I just hate drinking out of narrow straws and reusable straws seem to generally be much wider.\n\nReply\nreply\nOtops\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nWe are looking to get rid of plastic straws in all of our restaurants in Europe. One of the alternatives I am currently exploring is a company out of Barcelona called Sorbos. They make edible straws. Currently their straws are flavored but they are working on a neutral one. I should be receiving a few samples soon. For the record, most of their flavored straws are quite good and impart very little flavor into the cocktail/drink.\n\nhttp://wearesorbos.com/?lang=en\n\nReply\nreply\n \nr/Cynicalbrit\nThis makes me happy\nyoutube\n183 upvotes · 19 comments\nr/bingingwithbabish\nBinging With Babish Eats His Last Meal\nyoutube\n458 upvotes · 21 comments\nr/bingingwithbabish\nBinging with Babish: The Every Burger from Rick and Morty\nyoutube\n149 upvotes · 29 comments\nr/Cynicalbrit\nGeekenders - Jesse and Dodger RETURN!\nyoutube\n110 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nTrapping 200 Scammers in an Impossible Maze [22:31]\nyoutube\n155 upvotes · 13 comments\nr/FuckYourEamesLounge\nDieter Rams pointing at things he doesn't like\nyoutube\n117 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/boardgames\nSUSD Review: John Company\nyoutube\n519 upvotes · 384 comments\nr/MisterBald\nI Crossed The World's Deadliest Jungle: Darien Gap\nyoutube\n363 upvotes · 153 comments\nr/speedrun\nSuper Mario 64 - 70 Star in 46:37 by 🇯🇵ikori_o (prev: 46:41 by 🇨🇦Suigi 5 months ago)\nyoutube\n170 upvotes · 11 comments\nr/rct\nI found the location of all coaster icons in RCT2\nyoutube\n248 upvotes · 19 comments\nr/boardgames\n11 Gifts for Board Gamers (That Aren't Games)\nyoutube\n231 upvotes · 73 comments\nr/electronicmusic\nAlice Deejay - Better Off Alone (1997) [eurodance / house]\nyoutube\n237 upvotes · 46 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nCop Has Heart Attack-Innocent Man Charged With Manslaughter [07:54]\nyoutube\n284 upvotes · 52 comments\nr/Techno\nWhat genre is this and where can i get more of this?!!!\nyoutube\n402 upvotes · 184 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nLaurence Fishburne reads a former slave's incredible letter to his old master [6:29]\nyoutube\n141 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/sousvide\nOne of the more informative steak videos I've seen: Why Ripping Hot Is Too Hot? | TESTED\nyoutube\n128 upvotes · 43 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nMCU Defenders of The Status Quo [21:58]\nyoutube\n117 upvotes · 44 comments\nr/climbing\nBabsi Zangerl on the 4th Ascent of Meltdown (5.14c)\nyoutube\n120 upvotes · 13 comments\nr/Denmark\nI aften er det Mortens Aften der er ... det er så allerede i aften\nyoutube\n136 upvotes · 33 comments\nr/peloton\nGCN+ dead as of December 19th\nyoutube\n425 upvotes · 635 comments\nr/Techno\nJosh Wink - Higher State Of Consciousness (Tweekin Acid Funk) - 1995\nyoutube\n103 upvotes · 33 comments\nr/poker\nThere is a new poker show live on youtube and it's actually pretty great\nyoutube\n104 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
