There were toy soldiers, dominos, toothbrushes and hundreds of hardhats of every shape, size and color.\n\nThe researchers say the density of trash was the highest recorded anywhere in the world, despite Henderson Island's extreme remoteness. The island is located about halfway between New Zealand and Chile and is recognized as a UNESCO world heritage site.\n\nJennifer Lavers, a research scientist at Australia's University of Tasmania, was lead author of the report, which was published Tuesday in \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\"\n\nLavers said Henderson Island is at the edge of a vortex of ocean currents known as the South Pacific gyre, which tends to capture and hold floating trash.\n\n\"The quantity of plastic there is truly alarming,\" Lavers told The Associated Press. \"It's both beautiful and terrifying.\"\n\nShe said she sometimes found herself getting mesmerized by the variety and colors of the plastic that litters the island before the tragedy of it would sink in again.\n\nLavers and six others stayed on the island for 3½ months in 2015 while conducting the study. They found the trash weighed an estimated 17.6 tons and that more than two-thirds of it was buried in shallow sediment on the beaches.\n\nIn this 2015 photo provided by Jennifer Lavers, plastic debris is strewn on the beach on Henderson Island.\nAP\n\nLavers said she noticed green toy soldiers that looked identical to those her brother played with as a child in the early 1980s, as well as red motels from the Monopoly board game.\n\nShe said the most common items they found were cigarette lighters and toothbrushes. One of the strangest was a baby pacifier.\n\nShe said they found a sea turtle that had died after getting caught in an abandoned fishing net and a crab that was living in a cosmetics container.\n\nBy clearing a part of a beach of trash and then watching new pieces accumulate, Lavers said they were able to estimate that more than 13,000 pieces of trash wash up every day on the island, which is about 6 miles long and 3 miles wide.\n\nHenderson Island is part of the Pitcairn Islands group, a British dependency. It is so remote that Lavers said she missed her own wedding after the boat coming to collect the group was delayed.\n\nIn this 2015 photo provided by Jennifer Lavers, a crab uses as shelter a piece of plastic debris on the beach on Henderson Island.
