How easy would it be to penetrate human skin, for someone who has never stabbed anyone before? How about for the stomach? Just in case my stabbing arm is grabbed, I could just go for a quick stab to the stomach. How much force would it require? Please be as detailed as you can.\n\nI'm asking for self-defense purposes.\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nDarkninja39\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nWell...

If it's properly sharpened compare it to slicing a chicken breast with a filet knife...it doesn't take much. Stabbing? grab a pork shoulder and go to town.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago"
