So I've got a 32oz hydroflask wide mouth with a flex straw cap and while I realize that I shouldn't put hot liquids in it with the straw attached to the cap, I cannot find any conclusive answer to whether I can put hot liquid in the flask if I remove the straw lid but keep the straw cap on.",

I bought it at a Marshall‚Äôs for a great deal and it was the last one. Unfortunately, it was tgtbt as it‚Äôs missing one of the four parts to the lid. I already emailed them but their turnaround time says 5-7 days. Just curious if anyone has been in a similar situation. Hopefully, I won‚Äôt have to return it.\n\nu/MidnightSalem\n‚Ä¢\n23 hr. ago\nRefrigerator safety\n\nI just got a 40 oz hydro flask, fancy insulation and temp shield, etc. Is it gonna be safe in the fridge with the lid off?

My cup is in near mint condition besides the finish coming off in this one area. Am I wrong? I am afraid this is going to continue to spread. It appears to me there is dirt or something under the finish. They have offered me $5 after returning my tumbler (the recycle program).\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/is-this-normal-wear-and-tear-v0-oiibqrz9455c1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54f2ae0ff86b8687f93b303e843ec0d314fadeb5 https://preview.redd.it/is-this-normal-wear-and-tear-v0-v38morz9455c1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=86da83a08d8f92b9341c1b72544cfed744852a60\nu/sportclipshaircuts\n‚Ä¢\nPromoted\nNo matter what your style is, whether it's a tight fade or flowing locks, old timey or newfangled, Sport Clips has got you covered.

You can't tell when it's empty or just sitting, but if you grab it by the handle when it's full or if you hold it by the handle while washing it's really obvious. Is this because of age (I got it in 2020 or 2021, so it's really not that old), or improper care, or maybe just a defect that I didn't notice before? In any case, would this fall under warranty, or is there any way to fix it?\n\nu/Prior_Training_3368\n‚Ä¢\n8 days ago\nGrapefruit Combos\nQuestion/Discussion\n\nI just got my second Hydro in the color grapefruit and I‚Äôm wanting to see how everyone styled theirs.
