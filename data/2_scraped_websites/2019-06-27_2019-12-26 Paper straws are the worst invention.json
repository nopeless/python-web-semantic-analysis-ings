But holy fuck paper straws suck! I just can’t stand the texture of them, the fact they disintegrate in the drink if it’s in too long. We have to draw a line somewhere, and the paper straws is where I draw the line!\n\nEdit: For all you telling me to just buy a reusable straw, where am I going to carry it? In my pockets? I’m a guy, I don’t have a purse.\n\nArchived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.\nSort by:\nredwalk33\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nNot unpopular.

I swallow too much air when i use them ill feel like shit.\n\nSensitiveSnowpea\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThis is why I take a reusable silicone straw with me everywhere I go.
