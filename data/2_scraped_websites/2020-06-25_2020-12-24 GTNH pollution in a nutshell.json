All these memes make me want to try it out\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nSure, it's genuinely one of the best packs out there. Just be aware that it takes a lot of commitment and patience to get anywhere, and that it can easily take months to finish the pack, so you're in it for the long run.\n\nReply\nreply\n7 more replies\nDremsRevenge\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nNo. Like most gregtech packs instead of minimizing gregtechs problems(micro crafting, grind) It adds them to everything else. Anything fun takes irl months of pain to even get to. Sad because I LIKE gregtech but most packs that have gt decide to go full retard on \"expert mode\" bullshit\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 3%\nRank by size \nr/Portal\nPortal: Revolution now has a trailer!\nyoutube\n136 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/Factoriohno\nThe absolute shortest possible way to explain how trains work.
