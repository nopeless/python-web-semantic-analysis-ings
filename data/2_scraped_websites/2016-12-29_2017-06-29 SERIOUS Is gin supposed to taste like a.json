Is this supposed to be the case?\n\nIt doesn't taste bad, it just tastes like a tree.\n\ntradestation.com\nLearn More\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nJyrchi\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nIt's juniper and for most part it is supposed to taste like that, especially if it's a London Dry Gin. Here is an in-depth article about the usage of juniper in gins, if you're interested in reading whilst trying to get intoxicated: http://www.ginfoundry.com/botanicals/juniper/\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThanks, bubbie. I'm already there, but I'm read aloud anyway.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nRain12913\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nI always say that gin tastes like camping.\n\nReply\nreply\nScoobs93\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nI always think Christmas\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nLong-Island-Iced-Tea\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nWhen consumed alone, it does taste like that, and theoretically it should taste like that. Obviously there are gins where this \"pine note\" (i.e. juniper berries) will be very characteristic, and there are gins where it is not so pronounced. Very cheap gins simply taste like alcohol.\n\nWhen mixed with tonic, it should not have that taste. I am not exactly an expert on the topic, but it is my understanding that gin and tonic (as in, the cocktail) does not taste like gin AND tonic (as in, consuming gin and tonic simultaneously). Here you can read more about it.\n\nReply\nreply\nKingCurtisCat\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nI like a lot of lime in my gin and tonics. I think it tastes like sparkling lemonade.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nthefrc\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThere are some gins that taste like you're sucking directly from a pine tree too. Spruce, by Rogue comes to mind immediately.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nhenrirousseau\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\n(Serious) I have never tasted a tree.\n\nReply\nreply\nBlues2112\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nTL;DR - YES!\n\nTo qualify as gin, it needs to have juniper berries for flavoring. That's by definition, otherwise it isn't gin. Guess where those berries come from? Yup...pine trees!\n\nReply\nreply\nfaggjuu\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nNope...they come from the juniper trees! They belong to the cypress family.\n\nBut pine tree and junipers are both coniferous plants...so they have a little in common.\n\nReply\nreply\nJonJon77\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI know this is an extremely old sub but it came up when I googled “gin tastes like Pine-Sol.” I’ve always avoided it because when I tasted a decent brand when I was a teen, don’t remember the name, I hated the taste. It immediately made me think Pine-Sol.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nr/Netherlands\nWhy Vienna's housing is so affordable compared to Amsterdam?\nyoutube\n153 upvotes · 171 comments\nr/MisterBald\nI Crossed The World's Deadliest Jungle: Darien Gap\nyoutube\n362 upvotes · 151 comments\nr/TheHague\nThe destruction of the Hague during WW-II in color\nyoutube\n108 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/thenetherlands\nDe autoloze zondag was 50 jaar geleden.
