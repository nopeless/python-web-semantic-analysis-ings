He doesn’t say “from my perspective” - he honestly believes it.\n\n4 more replies\nOrimori24\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\n\"Amuro I'm about to do something wicked. \"\n\nIt really shows char cared very little for his father's philosophy and mostly pursued revenge.\n\n2 more replies\nCat_in_a_suit\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI came here to laugh at you.\n\nIn all seriousness, probably “everything’s red... I think I rather like it.” From The Origin, because it explains both why all his suits are red, and on a more metaphorical level, how much blood is covering the path he chooses to walk.\n\nKregano_XCOMmodder\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\n\"I've never betrayed anyone in my life.\"\n\nThat one is so fucking hilarious considering the shit we'd seen up to when Zeta was initially produced, and everything produced after that has made it even funnier.\n\n1 more reply\nRobertLBurr\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nMy favorite is when he kicked the Gundam in the abdomen. Because actions speak louder than words!\n\nMercuryo\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI came here to laugh at you from Zeta\n\nFrom CCA I like the final dialogue at the ending when Amuro is pushin back Axis\n\nHexManiak\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\n\"Hey Garma, do you read me? Blame this on the misfortune of your birth.\"\n\nCements Char as one cold motherfucker, and is just generally cool besides.\n\nComradeSomo\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThe whole Dakar speech.\n\ngundam_zabaniyah\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nOthers : something something about laughing Me, an Intellectual: https://i.imgtc.ws/ZDuPlPv.jpg https://i.imgtc.ws/nETorFa.jpg\n\nUden10\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nNever noticed that tiger wearing the mask before\n\nFeldt-2308\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nAnything he uses to justify dropping Axis. Forgot the wording but i loved it.
