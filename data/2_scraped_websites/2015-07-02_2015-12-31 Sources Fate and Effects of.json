These small pieces of plastic may enter the ocean as such, or may result from the fragmentation of larger items through the influence of UV radiation. Section 1 provides an introduction to the problem of microplastics in the marine environment, and the rationale for the assessment. The principal purpose of the assessment is to provide an improved evidence base, to support policy and management decisions on measures that might be adopted to reduce the input of microplastics to the oceans. The GESAMP assessment can be considered as contributing to a more formal Assessment Framework, such as the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact- Response (DPSIR) Assessment Framework, which is introduced in Section 2.\n\nTopics\nChemicals & pollution action Nature Action Environment under review\nDownload\nSources, Fate and Effects of Microplastics in the Marine Environment: A Global Assessment\nEnglish\nLearn about our work \nSign up for updates \nGet involved \nGOVERNANCE & LEADERSHIP\nExecutive Director\nDeputy Executive Director\nSenior Management Team\nCommittee of Permanent Representatives\nEnvironment Assembly - UNEA\nFUNDING & PARTNERS\nOverview\nCivil Society\nMember States\nPrivate Sector\nEnvironment Fund\nGlobal Environment Facility\nGreen Climate Fund\nCentres collaborating with UNEP\nSTRUCTURE\nDivisions and Offices\nEvaluation Office\nSecretariats and Conventions\nKEY DOCUMENTS\nAnnual Report\nMedium Term Strategy\nProgramme of Work and Budget\nSpeeches\nRESOURCES\nEnvironment and Social Safeguards\nFrequently Asked Questions\nIntergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) on Plastic Pollution\nKnowledge Repository\nKunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework\nPolicies & Strategies\nProjects – Open Data Portal\nSustainability at UNEP\nSustainable Development Goals\nUNEA Monitoring and Reporting Portal\nWorld Environment Situation Room\nREGIONAL PRESENCE\nAfrica\nAsia and the Pacific\nEurope\nLatin America and the Caribbean\nNew York Office\nNorth America\nWest Asia\nADVOCACY\nBeat Pollution\nChampions of the Earth\nClean Seas\nFaith for Earth\nGoodwill Ambassadors\nUN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration\nUN International Days\nUNEP at 50\nYoung Champions of the Earth\nMEDIA\nMedia Centre\nSocial Media\nNews, Stories & Speeches\nWORK WITH US\nCalls for Proposals\nJob Vacancies\nSUBSCRIBE TO THE UNEP NEWSLETTER\n\n© 2023 UNEP Terms of Use Privacy Report Project Concern Report Scam Contact Us"
