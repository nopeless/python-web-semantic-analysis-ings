If it’s buried in a sensible place and not thrown in the ocean I have zero issue with this.\n\nThis is a microscopic timeframe. If it’s buried in a place where it wont damage wildlife it’s not a problem.\n\nWe only view 600 years as “long term” because we don’t live that long and fear death.\n\nArchived post.

It's the toxicity of the plastic that is concerning. When plastic is buried in a landfill, those toxic chemicals start to break down, and seep into the water. Water treatment plants cannot remove chemicals like BPA, and therefore is in our drinking water.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nAnd its not possible to bury plastic in an area where the groundwater has minimal interaction with drinking water? Like if groundwater in an area goes out to sea - where it would be heavily diluted and breaks down extremely slowly anyway. So would have no impact on wildlife.\n\n4 more replies\nSpiderNeko\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThe problem is if that plastic ends up reaching ground water and polluting things like the wells in people's back yards or streams/lakes. It's hard to bury something like that and have no issues arise.\n\nThere just needs to be a bigger industry for recycling plastic. Then we wouldn't have to create so much new plastic, and we'd have less garbage waste.\n\njaspnlv\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nTrash to energy is a better solution\n\nUnpopularOpinionMods\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nIs this a Popular or Unpopular opinion?
