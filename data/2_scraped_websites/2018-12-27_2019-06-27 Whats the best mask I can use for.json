I've been soldering electronics since I was 11 yo, and now, when I do it, my breathing gets temporarily worse. I can't afford a fume extractor for now, so what masks can I use to filter the fumes?\n\nfidelity.com\nLearn More\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nttbnz\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI don't know about masks, but you could pretty easily build a fume extractor with a fan scavenged from a PC.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nlordlod\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nA Hakko smoke absorber costs $25\n\nhttps://www.aliexpress.com/item/FA-400-Smoking-Apparatus-Welding-Exhaust-Anti-Static-Smoke-Absorber-Efficiently-Non-Scaling-Horizontal/32944580073.html\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nInductorMan\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThe cheapest mask that can actually do anything runs about $35-$45: a NIOSH OV/P100, such as this. N95 masks won't do much. They might filter out most smoke particulates, but the vapor from the flux will still be there.\n\nA fume extractor is going to be far more affordable than this. Not an activated charcoal filter one, just a fan with the little \"charcoal filter\" screen that goes in front. FYI those screens don't do shit... except maybe laminarize the flow through the fan, which is actually a good thing. But the fan is what's doing the work here, reducing the particulate concentration near your face.\n\nIf you have the right kind of space you can make yourself an even better system with some dryer ducting, a 120mm PC case fan, and some duct tape: you can use this to exhaust the fumes entirely outside of the building by routing the ducting out the window. You need to arrange the fan either in the middle of the ducting or at the exhaust end so that the turbulence of the fan doesn't throw smoke all around. And you just tape the dryer ducting to the fan, and tape that to the exhaust (which can be as simple as a sheet of cardboard with a round hole in it that you put in an open window). Works great. I have one that has the intake end of the duct taped to a magnifying desk lamp with the magnifier removed so I can position the intake wherever I want. Also provides extra light, 'cause it's a lamp!\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/flipperzero\nFinally, FlipperPhone!
