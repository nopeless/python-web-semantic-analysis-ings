Not only would this be hilarious, it could serve as a tool for character development for him. What if his new found infamy makes him a target to stronger enemies forcing him to fight more serious opponents and slowly making him the brave warrior he is trying to be. Or the new bounty can be a new ego boost to him like sogeking was in the past.\n\nJB76\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nSince his first bounty was as much as Luffy's first I'm gonna say the trend continues and he bumps to 100 mil\n\n1 more reply\nRobertOConnor\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nEveryone saw what Zoro did so his should increase.\n\nGod usopp should get one from his hype.\n\nLuffy will Obviously get one.\n\nFranky will get one from taking on the marines and doffys executives at the same time.\n\nNico robin hasn't done anything too important infront of the marines that i can think off so hers might stay (maybe her presence alone might make it increase 20 mil or so).\n\nAnd maybe Sanji from his small confrontation with Fuji.\n\nThe rest shouldn't get an increase.\n\nChatcha31\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nWe still have to consider their action in Fishman Island, because all of the Straw Hats had parts in the fighting. It was only one or two weeks ago in the One Piece timeline, and we've not heard any increases yet. Potentially their influence in Fishman Island combined with their actions on Punk Hazard and (for some) Dressarosa, will give all the gang new bounties\n\n3 more replies\nBlameReborn\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nI hope everyone gets a huge increase especially after this 2 year spanning conflict\n\nzareason\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nLuffy should get the highest bounty in the world. Though it all depends on fujitoras report.\n\nkumaLol\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nEventually at the end of the series he will xD something like 2bill beli or something. After this arc though, hoping for 500m for Luffy. In all the 2 years no other supernova got above this (as far as we know), so 500m seems highly reasonable I'd say.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nBig :)\n\nZehahahaha\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nNone of the Sunnies, that's for sure.\n\n2 more replies\nstonedsoviet420\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nPersonally I don't think they will increase\n\nEyezin\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nUnchanged.\n\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/OnePiece\nOne Piece and The NFL's Los Angeles Rams will have a collaboration on December 3rd!\ninstagram\n305 upvotes · 70 comments\nr/OnePunchMan\n[OC] Nameless insect Monster Sculpt Timelapse\nyoutube\n141 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/Dandadan\nAnime announcement\nyoutube\n1.1K upvotes · 113 comments\nr/hajimenoippo\nTotally Not Mark Reviews Hajime no Ippo: East Japan Rookie Tournament\nyoutube\n255 upvotes · 61 comments\nr/dragonball\nDragon Ball: Sparking!
