It can be found polluting the tallest mountains to the deepest ocean trenches, and can affect human health, destroy ecosystems, and harm wildlife – especially marine species. The plastic waste problem has been aggravated in recent decades as the consumption of this versatile material has continued to rise. Global plastics production has doubled since the beginning of the century, to almost 400 million metric tons per year in 2021. While the lifespan of plastic products averages around 10 years, plastics can take up to 500 years to decompose, depending on their composition and disposal.\nShow more\nPublished by Bruna Alves
