I was wondering which type of glue would would be better, and I was wondering if magnetizing is worth it if the set has multiple weapon choices.\n\ndirect.playstation.com\nShop Now\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nImahumin\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nIf you have never built a kit before don’t magnetize. I would suggest super glue. It is more forgiving and doesn’t melt the mini if you add too much. It also lets you pry it apart after a dunk in the freezer if you mess up.\n\nReply\nreply\nTyr1326\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI find plastic glue more forgiving. It gets a bit tacky before it sets, allowing you to correct errors. Superglue is either set or its not, nothing inbetween. And sure, you can break it apart. But it also sticks to your fingers, to parts you didnt intend, etc.\n\nReply\nreply\nfrostape\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nMagnetizing: Absolutely\n\nPlastic glue is great for model stability. But you have to be sure you've got things how you want them, because fixing mistakes will require cutting. Plastic glue melts the plastic so that it sets as a single piece of plastic.\n\nSuper glue is more forgiving with mistakes, but is more brittle. You can pretty easily snap a super glued piece off (or watch it snap after you drop it accidentally).\n\nPersonally, I love plastic glue for modeling and then super glue it to the base (in case I ever need to re-base the model)\n\nReply\nreply\nchaos0xomega\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nIf you're magnetizing you will need to use superglue, as plastic glue will not bond the magnets to the plastic (duh).\n\nPersonally I prefer plastic glue, but only because you can get it in a bottle with a needle-applicator tip or a brush-on applicator that allows for precision placement of the glue. Otherwise most superglue nozzles are larger and don't allow for precise application and they have a tendency to clog up as well.\n\nReply\nreply\nRokanos\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nSome quick tips:\n\nDry fit everything before you put any glue on.\n\nUse plastic glue if it is a plastic model kit, superglue (gel) for magnets, and thin superglue for resin (make sure you clean the resin first!)\n\nMagnetizing is worth it, if you can stomach the extra time involved, aren't in a hurry, or having trouble decided which weapons you like best. Basically, if you think you can handle doing magnets, do it.\n\nSuperglue tends to get EVERYWHERE, so be careful. You want to use it sparingly (use less than you think, and then use slightly less than that). Don't know how many times I've seen friends end up with half a bottle of superglue on their model, gunking up detail and everything else.\n\nUltimately, use what works best for you. Some people prefer superglue because they find it easier to work with. Some people prefer plastic glue for the same reason. You may end up using a combination of different glues - So long as the end result is what you are looking for, it doesn't really matter.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nRelated\nWarhammer\nMiniatures game\nTabletop games\nforward\nback\nr/mordheim\nMore shots of my Warcry « Mordheim » board\n193 upvotes · 15 comments\nr/BeastsOfChaos\nMy herd\n110 upvotes · 12 comments\nr/Warhammer40k\nWarhammer maker Games Workshop hands staff £2,500 bonus\nstandard.co.uk\n1.1K upvotes · 192 comments\nr/killteam\nAdeptus Spookanicus Killteam Kitbash (WIP)\n152 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/killteam\nThe El'Ucian Startraders - a custom T'au Kill Team\n639 upvotes · 33 comments\nr/killteam\nStrike Force “Salaryman Japan”!\n102 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/Tau40K\nThere is currently an ongoing Kickstarter project called \"The Cyber Samurai Dynasty,\" which combines space marines, tau, and Japanese Samari.\n213 upvotes · 32 comments\nr/killteam\nIron warriors Legionary Champion\n108 upvotes · 6 comments\nr/killteam\nKillteam v Killteam v The Zombie Horde\n388 upvotes · 31 comments\nr/killteam\nWIP Sisters of Pain (Legionaries Stand-ins)\n148 upvotes · 10 comments\nr/killteam\nFarstalker Kinband\n109 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/killteam\nMy Deadspace inspired Imperial Navy Breachers.\n218 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/killteam\nKasrkin Sharpshooter, final member of the team\n146 upvotes · 10 comments\nr/killteam\n30K Sons of Horus Legionary kill team\n263 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/killteam\nKasrkin ready for battle\n114 upvotes · 3 comments\nr/Conquest\nSiegebreaker Behemoth\n142 upvotes · 6 comments\nr/killteam\nSons of Medusa Kill team\n283 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/killteam\nImperial fist kill team\n117 upvotes · 11 comments\nr/killteam\nMy attempt at an Exaction Squad Kill Team\n116 upvotes · 6 comments\nr/onepagerules\nThe Scorn Legion marches out...\n143 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/killteam\nKillteam scatter terrain made from junk!
