Or that our oceans now contain billions of pounds of plastic?\n\nPlastic is a substance the earth cannot digest. If you‚Äôre fired up about our health and the health of our planet, we have good news: so are we. Here are 20 things we all can do to stand up, speak out, and take action against plastic pollution.\n\n20. Stop buying plastic bottled water. Get a reusable bottle and refill it.\n\n19. Just say no to single-use plastic grocery bags. Bring your own bags wherever you shop.\n\n18. Learn the facts about plastic pollution. That ‚Äúfloating continent‚Äù of plastic garbage in the Pacific Ocean is only the tip of the iceberg. Plastic doesn‚Äôt biodegrade; it photodegrades, meaning it breaks up into smaller and smaller pieces, creating a plastic soup in our oceans.\n\n17. Watch Jeff Bridges speak the truth about plastic, and take the pledge to refuse disposable plastic.\n\n16. Learn how to start a plastic bag ban in your town.\n\n15. Join our global Coalition. Our voices are stronger together.\n\n14. Refuse plastic straws in your drink. Get used to saying ‚ÄúNo, straw please,‚Äù when dining out.\n\n13. Ask local restaurants to serve straws only on request. You can leave this card at your table.\n\n12. Forgo takeout containers. Bring your own reusable container or eat in at restaurants.\n\n11. Sign the petition to stop Nestle‚Äôs unregulated water bottling in California.\n\n10. Give up plastic wraps and bags. Purchase alternatives or reuse glass jars.\n\n9. Donate to Plastic Pollution Coalition. We are working toward a world free of toxic plastic pollution, and we need all hands on deck.\n\n8. Cook real food whenever possible. Packaged food is often wrapped in plastic. Thousands of chemicals are used in food packaging and can migrate into the food or liquid they hold.\n\n7. Vote with your dollars. Pay attention to the entire lifecycle of items you bring into your life, from source to manufacturing to distribution to disposal. Demand better alternatives to disposable plastic.\n\n6. Join a beach clean up. Use the interactive map to find a cleanup site near you.\n\n5. Choose clothes made with natural fibers whenever possible. Synthetic clothes shed small plastic fibers when washed that pollute rivers and oceans.\n\n4. Refuse ‚Äústyrofoam‚Äù food and drink containers. ‚ÄúStyrofoam‚Äù or polystyrene is carcinogenic to animals and is a probable human carcinogen. Learn how to start a styrofoam ban in your town.\n\n3. Photograph plastic pollution wherever you live. Use this app to record plastic pollution anywhere in the world.\n\n2. Refuse personal care products with plastic microbeads. Toothpastes and face and body washes can contain tiny plastic beads that end up in our waterways. Learn more about the products that contain microbeads and what you can do to stop this pollution.\n\n1. Make your voice heard! Keep talking to your friends, relatives, and neighbors about plastic pollution and our environment. Use the facts and research you‚Äôve found here to help your community understand the issue, so they can also stand up to Big Oil and go plastic free. Only together can we achieve a world free of plastic pollution.\n\nFollow us on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, tumblr, Pinterest, or YouTube.

Non-recicleable bags for organic apples? Really?!?! And we call ourselves the pinnacle of evolution? We, humans, are so so very stupid to create something that lasts for over 400 years to be used only once! Just ridiculous!

I‚Äôm working in the local townhall and am looking for ways to educate people for some time now. this Website is a gift of god! tomorrow is monday and I can‚Äôt wait to put these tips into practice.\n\ngoffinet.mclaren@gmail.com says:\nAugust 14, 2018 at 2:58 pm\n\nMy group is along the Grand Strand in South Carolina. We ate the Chirping Bird Society.\nWe chirp, cheep and chitter about plastic litter. We also have members who are ‚Äòscreaming eagles‚Äô!\nWe attend local events, make power point presentations, screen movies, the latest being Chris Jordan‚Äôs ALBATROSS. We visit our legislators in DC and locally and try to vote in candidates who are ‚ÄòOcean Champions.‚Äô We succeeded with plastic bag bans in Beaufort, Folly Beach, Mount Pleasant, Isle of Palms, Surfside and are now working on Georgetown and North Myrtle Beach.\nWe are about 500 strong and we are definitely making progress despite the fact that SC is a very conservative state but we are following the example of other countries especially Britain since Sir David Attenborough‚Äôs Blue Planet II Series about the impact of plastic on marine life.\nWe also donate the book, \"Sullie Saves the Seas\" to help educate children about the consequences of abandoning plastic on beaches.\n\n4724008@student.eacs.k12.in.us says:\nMarch 19, 2019 at 5:32 pm\nWe must reduce our plastic dependency\n\nWe use an incredible quantity of single-use plastic items, such as straws, plastic bags, packaging, plastic cups, plates and cutlery. We must put an end to it. An increasing number of countries have now imposed a ban on disposable plastics and plastic bags, or established concrete targets for reducing plastic consumption and waste. This effort must be scaled up, so that global plastic consumption goes down. You can do your part by refusing to use these products.\n\nIncreased producer responsibility\n\nOver the past 50 years, world plastic production has doubled, and leading plastic manufacturers are planning to increase production by almost a third over the next five years. In 1974, the average per capita plastic consumption was 2kg. Today, this has increased to 43kg! This is taking the world in the wrong direction. Instead, alternatives to non-degradable plastics must be developed, and the industries responsible for the major plastic wastes must be targeted with specific industry agreements and producer liability arrangements, with requirements for handling, collection and reuse of waste and broken plastic equipment.\n\nA member of Algeria‚Äôs Under the Sea diving club collects plastic bottles.\nA member of Algeria‚Äôs Under the Sea diving club collects plastic bottles.\nImage: Reuters/Zohra Bensemra\n3. Increase fees and taxes on polluting plastics\n\nMost of the plastics used today are produced from oil, and are a source of both climate emissions and pollution. As an example, in Norway only 0.5 percent of the plastic is renewable. Despite that, fossil plastic is still cheaper to make and buy than the renewable. Governments need to investigate implementing a tax or fee on polluting plastics. The fees must be changed so that recycled plastic becomes cheaper than fossil.\n\nIncreased waste management where the problem is greatest\n\nThe bulk of plastic waste comes from developing countries. Rapid population growth and a swelling middle class means the consumption of plastic is increasing faster than the capacity to handle the plastic waste, and therefore much of the excess ends up in the sea. China and Indonesia are among the countries that produce the most plastic waste. As part of the solution, an international aid programme should be established to develop waste management and recycling infrastructure.\n\nImplementation of the zero vision for ocean plastic\n\nIn December 2017, the UN Environment Assembly adopted a global goal to stop the discharge of plastic to the sea. As a follow-up, an international agreement with firm targets and time frames for implementation should be established, ensuring the mapping of sources of marine waste, increased market responsibility to prevent new propagation and strengthening of waste management globally.\n\nIncreased mapping, surveillance and research\n\nThere is still much we do not know about the plastic problem. Researchers estimate that more than 70 percent of the plastic ends up on the sea floor. Over time, it breaks down into tiny particles, but we do not know what happens to this material or how to get rid of it. The efforts to map and monitor, as well as conduct research on the negative effects, must be strengthened. An important initiative in this direction is REV, the world‚Äôs largest research and expedition vessel, which aims to solve the biggest challenges around the ocean, including a dedicated effort on plastic.\n\nfreeguysf@gmail.com says:\nMay 17, 2019 at 11:23 am\n\nThe problem is plastic material itself, made from petroleum based chemicals. These chemicals are known to cause cancer, and disrupt normal endocrine processes in the body.\nOne core solution is natural plastic replacement material, such as plant based eco products that biodegrade completely over time. Made from completely natural, non-petroleum sources, these products are benign when exposed to natural elements and break down back into organic nutrients.\nThe way this disaster finally improves is when countries and governments, ie people around the world demand it.\nOther improvements and temporary fixes are welcomed. However, with trillions of plastic items being produced in the world each year, time is running out on the devastation we‚Äôre causing to our mother Earth.\nThanks for caring!\n\nAquilakings450@gmail.com says:\nAugust 13, 2019 at 2:44 am\n\nFound in a society where environmental knowledge is little, and plastic pollution is rapidly on the rise, i educate young people about the need to join the fight against plastic pollution and take personal action. This changes their view of the problem, and therefore , they join me in the fight against plastic pollution .\nI hope i can do more and solve this problem in my community.\n\nmoxleykarmacapitalinc@yahoo.com says:\nAugust 30, 2019 at 8:16 pm\n\nIt‚Äôs sad that people are so naive, it‚Äôs such a shame that our young generation has no clue the affects of plastic chemicals in our food, and water, air, makeup sunscreen i mean i can make a list out of this world! IT‚ÄôS TIME WE STAND UP OR WERE GOING TO BE IN BIG TROUBLE. PEOPLE PLEASE DON‚ÄôT FORGET THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST! THEY SAY IT‚ÄôS ON FIRE!!!\n\nsjwithaneye@gmail.com says:\nSeptember 10, 2019 at 5:00 pm\n\nWhy aren‚Äôt we re-using the plastic containers we already have, instead of throwing them out to then spend money on MORE containers? I‚Äôm talking about your laundry detergent, your dish soap, your cleaning supplies ‚Äì they all come in these big containers that neither disintegrate nor are damaged by ONE USE. Corporations need to look into a better method of getting those supplies to us. Set up a ‚Äòstore‚Äô in the nontraditional sense, where we can bring these containers with their labels or not, weigh out the container, pay for the product. What is so rocket-science about that? We are burning our brains trying to figure out how to recycle materials, but that itself is polluting in another way. I hate throwing these into my recycle bin, I want to reuse this stuff. Don‚Äôt some countries make ROADS of this stuff? It does not break down easily!\n\nseo.planetsolutionsgroup@gmail.com says:\nOctober 4, 2020 at 12:01 pm\n\nGreat suggestions. Plastic pollution is one of the greatest threats to ocean health worldwide. Many organizations are working to reduce plastic in the ocean. But I think we must think to stop plastic from source.
