I feel like I have to start over 😩 cause idk if “ messenger” means someone else in their body or if it means that they just have more knowledge coming back that they consider themselves messengers. Also how TF he die???? I legit went through like 3 episodes rewinding to find the scene and I just don’t know how I missed it and why no one was like “yo bro how you die?”\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\njmusball\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nHe died when he was at the restaurant with his father. He went to the restroom and slipped and hit his head on the sink. In that moment he died and came back within seconds\n\nReply\nreply\nalisquires\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI have been wondering this same thing. Thank you so much for answering! It was driving me crazy.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n2 more replies\njmusball\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nAlso, I believe they are called messengers. The term was only used once at the end of the show. But in earlier episodes, one of the messenger characters said when the group came back from the dead, he was “triggered”, leading us to believe something was inside him\n\nReply\nreply\nmakeavinii\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nYou’re very helpful!!!\n\nReply\nreply\nflippychick\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThey always die and come back straight away. That’s what sets them apart. no one even really notices that they actually died, except Sarah because she was in a hospital\n\nReply\nreply\nbadken\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThis really freaked me out, too. I spent most of the season going \"wtf is up with James?\"\n\nFinally I went back and watched recaps of season 1 and 2 on YouTube and I skimmed through the first episode and caught the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment. Bad writing on that one. There was NO reference to what had happened later on in the show except that James was acting weird, until he did the weird mouth-to-mouth information exchange with Phil. Even that didn't make sense to me, because I didn't remember anything like that happening before.\n\nI spent most of the 3rd season episodes completely confused about James.\n\nReply\nreply\nspinalcloud\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThey already explained that whole bit in previous seasons with Sarah, though. The reveal of her being one of the 'messengers' trying to kill the Risen was a surprise because nobody in the show even knew that she died giving birth. That's what was so gut wrenching about it all to James. Phil died on the oil rig in the explosion then instantly stood up and Terminator'd back to Yoorana. James did the exact same thing after conking his head on a sink and bleeding out of both ears.\n\nAnd I mean... him and William conspiring to kill all the Risen should have tipped you off long before he reprogrammed Phil in the woods. There was a lot wrong with this season but James being a messenger wasn't hidden.\n\nReply\nreply\nthekindlyman555\n•\n4 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 4 yr. ago\n\nThis really freaked me out, too. I spent most of the season going \"wtf is up with James?\" Finally I went back and watched recaps of season 1 and 2 on YouTube and I skimmed through the first episode and caught the blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment.\n\nThis is a really interesting comment to me because I personally noticed it right away and it felt SUPER SUPER obvious to me and his change in behaviour was immediate and just left me feeling super uneasy for most of the season. He went from weepy and completely broken up about Sarah to completely cold and determined after leaving the bathroom. Also the way it was shot with him having his eyes closed and several seconds of close up before dramatic eye opening and another 10 seconds of closeup on his face made it obvious that something important had just happened.\n\nI will agree with the mouth to mouth (and also the random plot whistle macguffin) being completely out of left field and lazy writing though.\n\nReply\nreply\n4 more replies\nlaurenkayxoxo\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThe first couple seasons of this show were great, I feel like something must’ve gone wrong because the writing became intolerable. Sarah dying after childbirth was obvious to me, but I kept asking myself when the hell James died. Then after that, it seems like everyone was dying just by getting a bump on the head. Seems really cheap to me. And then in the end, they all just sacrifice themselves for the greater good? I’m sorry but that doesn’t fit with Kirstie’s character. I’ve got so many issues with how this ended.\n\nReply\nreply\ntiffamato77\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI know I'm fucking WAY late to this...but dammit, I'm just now watching it!!! Don't judge me, please!! I thought that Sarah HAD to have died in the delivery room. From the sheer amount of blood loss, but they made us wait to know for sure. With James, I literally paused Season 3, Episode 1 at 22:35 (into episode) and searched here to see if he legit died like THAT!! What a major loss!! I don't want to watch him be heartless. 🥲 😔😭😢 but I'll be damned if I stop now!!\n\nReply\nreply\nazteacher1\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nWhen he went to eat with his Dad he fell in the bathroom and hit his head on the sink.\n\nReply\nreply\nKajache59\n•\n15 days ago\n\nI could've sworn they made the sink scene look like a dream. Gonna have to go back.🤔😞\n\nReply\nreply\nazteacher1\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nHow did everyone miss that? It is is the whole premiss of the show not bad writing at all It just shocked me, so I guess it was great writing because I was not expecting that. The energy from the Risen experiment caused those who died to be triggered.\n\nReply\nreply\nMarylumac52\n•\n2 mo. ago\n\nWasn't Phil far away from all the energy when he died? Also I'm so confused about William. When did he become a messenger?\n\nReply\nreply\nCreative_Cat7679\n•\n21 days ago\n\nSarah clearly died in the hospital every damn. The doctor said \" we lost her for a second she was clinically dead\" James suspected instantly but didn't wanna believe it.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nr/MisterBald\nI Crossed The World's Deadliest Jungle: Darien Gap\nyoutube\n364 upvotes · 153 comments\nr/Cynicalbrit\nGeekenders - Jesse and Dodger RETURN!\nyoutube\n110 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/Cynicalbrit\nThis makes me happy\nyoutube\n183 upvotes · 19 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nTrapping 200 Scammers in an Impossible Maze [22:31]\nyoutube\n155 upvotes · 13 comments\nr/Netherlands\nWhy Vienna's housing is so affordable compared to Amsterdam?\nyoutube\n153 upvotes · 173 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nMCU Defenders of The Status Quo [21:58]\nyoutube\n117 upvotes · 44 comments\nr/TheHague\nThe destruction of the Hague during WW-II in color\nyoutube\n111 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/cringe\nNever forget where we came from\nyoutube\n127 upvotes · 38 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nLaurence Fishburne reads a former slave's incredible letter to his old master [6:29]\nyoutube\n141 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/cringe\nThe comments on videos about sigma males is a gold mine\nyoutube\n474 upvotes · 216 comments\nr/ABroadInJapan\nHow to Spend 14 Days in JAPAN 🇯🇵 Ultimate Travel Itinerary\nyoutube\n129 upvotes · 21 comments\nr/eurovision\nBlanca Paloma - Jaleo (Spain 2023)\nyoutube\n107 upvotes · 15 comments\nr/LEMMiNO\nThe Backpacker Who Vanished\nyoutube\n203 upvotes · 56 comments\nr/Lostwave\nThe Filthy Frank Kenya Song has been found\nyoutube\n322 upvotes · 45 comments\nr/eurovision\nLahjakäärijä - \"The gift wrapper\"\nyoutube\n95 upvotes · 10 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
