Some ideas:\n\n- Ghostface: Middle finger\n\n- Huntress: Close call on hatchet hitting Survivors head\n\n- Doctor: Laughs menacingly\n\n- Demo: Rips doors wide open and then shouts at Survivor\n\n- Sadako: Shows her Inexorable Stare\n\n- Chucky: Survivors can see Charles Lee Ray manifesting\n\nView full post\nu/Its_not_a_mantis\nâ€¢\n20 hr. ago\nIt somehow kept getting worse...\nShitpost / Meme\nu/vonderhorn\nâ€¢\n3 hr. ago\nHas anybody else unlocked the secret Freddy's skin added in the latest update?\nQuestion\nu/haemschder\nâ€¢\n16 hr. ago\nNew Dwight skin looks crazy\nShitpost / Meme\nu/Leaucard\nâ€¢\n12 hr. ago\nOne would be cool and the other would be the most disturbing thing added to dbd.\nShitpost / Meme\nu/Standard-Muffin\nâ€¢\n14 hr. ago\nThe Frank we deserve\nShitpost / Meme\nu/LUKXE-\nâ€¢\n13 hr. ago\nShould de-pipping exist?\nDiscussion\n\nI'm certain that this has been moaned about plenty of times by plenty of others, but this emblem and pipping system seems even more confusing than normal lately.\n\nAs Killer, I have de-pipped despite a 10 hook game and as Survivor, I have just completed 3 gens and taken chase, healed and escaped only to de-pip anyway.\n\nIt's almost as if the current system isn't calculating events properly (or at all)\n\nWith all the RNG and busted set-ups (certain maps, perks/addons) is it time that de-pipping was no longer possible?\n\nu/TheDreadOne-\nâ€¢\n7 hr. ago\nOh my God...
