When I pour it down the drain in notice there's still a noticeable amount left that's kinda difficult to get rid of. We use these other vials for testing and I've noticed the same thing with them too (they're made of borosilicate, not sure about the test tubes).\n\nI don't seem to notice this when washing dishes at home though.\n\nArchived post.

These silanol groups are Si-OH formed when oxygen atoms dangling from the surface of the SiO4 matrix react with moisture in the air. They form hydrogen bonds with liquid water, causing it to adhere to the surface of the glass very strongly. This won't happen as much with dishes and cookware because they often receive special coatings (e.g. PTFE/Teflon) specifically to prevent this adhesion.\n\n1 more reply\nGodCarcass\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nPolarity of water by hydrogen bonding. It's kind of like a tiny weak magnet with a constantly changing positive and negative charge. Thus making it stick to its self and other objects, and giving rise to its surface tension.\n\n404X\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nBecause water is slightly charged, when around other water molecules they form a bond, not strong enough to be almost solid and almost impenetrable but enough that other molecules will stick together (or \"hold hands\".)\n\n7 more replies\nron_leflore\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nIt's because your test tube is hydrophillic, which basically means that the water molecules interaction with the surface is energetically more favorable than water molecules interacting with themselves.\n\nIf you don't want the water to stick, get hydrophobic test tubes.\n\n \n16\nRank by size \nRelated\nScience\nforward\nback\nr/pics\nSurface tension\n2.3K upvotes · 433 comments\nr/chemistry\nI thought this was a cool illustration of surface tension\n801 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/Python\nWhat the Heck Are Monads?!\nyoutube\n130 upvotes · 52 comments\nr/funny\nYeah, bro.
