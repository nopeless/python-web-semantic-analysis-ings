Are we polluting the environment through our personal care?\n31 May 2015\n\nThis paper focuses on the emerging issue of plastic particles in personal care and cosmetic product (PCCP) formulations as a possible source of micro-sized plastic litter. Known as ‘microbeads’, when used in PCCPs, these microplastic ingredients are solid materials that fall under the definition of marine litter when emitted to the marine environment. The concern is that plastic ingredients in products that are being used by consumers in households worldwide are contributing to the total abundance of plastic particles smaller than 5 mm in the ocean today.\n\nTopics\nClimate Action\nDownload\nPlastic in cosmetics.
