Whenever I get a paper straw at a restaurant, I just remove it and drink without the straw. I don't care if plastic straws are bad for the environment; at least they fucking work!",

Why Wendy? What was wrong with the paper ones?\n\n5 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nPlastic Straws are just a strawman for the devastating impacts of all plastics and petroleum products.\n\nRagingSteel\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nAnd then there's the fuckers who put fruit in plastic bags/packs when they've got a fucking skin.\n\n1 more reply\nHeterophylla\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nPaper straws are not great. It's like drinking through a spit-ball.\n\n2 more replies\nforgetasitype\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nWe will never get rid of plastics. Our focus has to be on either creating plastics from renewable sources that can be composted, or using regular plastics as fuel and capturing the chemical byproducts. The straw bans are the result of the propaganda that the plastics problem is due to us the consumer. It’s a sad joke.\n\n1 more reply\nCalgaryChris77\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nIf you are talking about shopping bags, they are getting outlawed as fast as straws are,if not faster.\n\nBut yeah, it's industrial waste mostly, fishing lines. And the litter from places across the world, that don't have top of the line waste management like we have here in the west that cause the majority of it.\n\n7 more replies\nLostwithoutpaint\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nAbsolute bullshit about the paper straws. They are horrible to drink out of. They make everything taste like paper and 1/4 way through the beverage it collapses. Don’t get me started on drinking a frozen drink with these monsters. 4 sips in and you are fucked thinking that viral turtle pic with the straw up his nose wasn’t sad, survival of the fittest. Either no straws or plastic none of this paper bullshit.\n\nBreezyWrigley\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nWell, to be fair, at least a lot of the other plastics are serving some real purpose. Straws are just pointless waste from the very moment they are manufactured. They are completely unnecessary. Small portion that they may be, they can just be removed completely because they're pointless.\n\n1 more reply\nDGlen\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nPlastic 6 pack rings were never the majority of our waste either. It doesn't mean they don't have a disproportionate effect on the environment.\n\nmylifeisbro1\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nIt’s just the 1% spinning their wheels there isn’t a way to stopping economies for the planet.\n\nPolar_Ted\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nIf you want to see large scale plastic waste visit a hospital.\n\nPhilosecfari\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nAt least there it’s justified for sterility/safety reasons.\n\nBobRawrley\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nSo we should not better the world if it doesn't fix everything in one fell swoop? No one expects the oceans to be clean just because plastic straws are gone. But at least it's a start.\n\nGenerallySalty\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI mean yes there's a looong way to go but this is still good. Think of all the straws a national fast food chain gives out. Millions. That's a shitload of garbage not going into the environment, plus it normalizes the idea of trying to not use plastic in people's heads.\n\nireaditdoyou\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nTotally. It's just sucking a Pepsi through paper \"thinking yes this is better\" while staring at the plastic lid seems odd to me.\n\n1 more reply\nJake01Holt\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThey are great until McDonald's literally admit its harder to recycle them and they cost more carbon and electricity to make\n\nBlownHappyKid\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nPaper straws are fucking ridiculous.\n\nPeople are literally destroying trees to make paper and disposing of plastic to prevent pollution.\n\nInstead of being more responsible, recycling, and not littering they choose they pussy out.\n\nwork_bois\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nDude, nobody is making paper from rainforest (I know you didn't say that, but give me a bit.). They make it from the shittest wood from the fastest-growing trees possible cause they're the cheapest -- and you only need the cellulose/pulp to make paper. It's mostly pine trees, which can be farmed en-masse and regrown within a decade or less.\n\nPaper isn't the problem here, it is the plastic, because that's not sustainable and non-biodegradable.\n\nnightmarefuel62\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThe issue with plastic straws is more about the shape. They get stuck in turtles noses for example\n\n4 more replies\nView more comments\n \n11\nRank by size \nr/todayilearned\nTIL: The Prionailurus rubiginosus or \"Rusty Spotted Cat\" is the world's smallest cat.
