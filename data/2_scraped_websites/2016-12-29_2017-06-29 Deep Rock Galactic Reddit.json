But for my surprise, it was extremely easy, we got the battery pack thing and the lost helmet at the same time, two drillers joined our session mid game too which helped us a lot at fighting the last glyphid boss (it was the glyphid bosses mission) and when we cleared all objectives, a golden detonator appeared and it was a breeze killing him, the drillers quickly mined the gold with their c4s, we called the drop pod and we left safe and sound. 101/10 cave, would definetly do another haz 4 mission again.
