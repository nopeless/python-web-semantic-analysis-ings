What I received had one slight difference from the pictures. In the toy I got, the small white parts (look almost like rubber tubing in the pictures) that go through the wicker balls and tie the colorful plastic disks together are replaced with plastic drinking straws. I'm now wary to put this in my budgies cage.\n\nAre plastic straws okay to be chewed on by a budgie? They do not seem to be sharp at the edges. I got this toy because he is a young bird and likes to destroy everything I put in there. Is there a danger of him chewing and ingesting the plastic or possibly creating a sharpness and cutting himself? If I were to replace the straws, what would be a good material to use that is safe for my budgie to chew on? Thanks.\n\nbusiness.comcast.com\nLearn More\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\ndaniinad\nâ€¢\n6 yr. ago\n\nMy birds steal my plastic drinking straws and always chew on them. They don't break off pieces and have never swallowed any so I wouldn't worry too much.\n\nIf you feel its a concern and it bothers you then perhaps you can use some bird safe twine and thread the toy parts through with that and discard the straws. :)\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n \nTop 2%\nRank by size \nRelated\nBudgie\nPet bird\nPet\nAnimals and Pets\nforward\nback\nr/budgies\nRIP Beanie <3\n204 upvotes Â· 20 comments\nr/budgies\nRIP Beacon\n107 upvotes Â· 12 comments\nr/budgies\nSheâ€™s sooo pretty ðŸ¥°\n159 upvotes Â· 23 comments\nr/cockatiel\nBirthday Boy!!!!!\n111 upvotes Â· 4 comments\nr/budgies\nChiro passed away\n377 upvotes Â· 32 comments\nr/budgies\nBudgie cone of shame\n703 upvotes Â· 34 comments\nr/budgies\nJet and Grub\n104 upvotes Â· 6 comments\nr/budgies\nI miss my Lemon so muchâ€¦ (Leaved her)\n168 upvotes Â· 17 comments\nr/budgies\nUPDATE: It turns out that Sunny does NOT have cancer!
