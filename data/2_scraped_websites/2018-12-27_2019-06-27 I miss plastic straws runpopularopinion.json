I know my sipping pleasure isnt worth the years of ecological damage. I know that paper straws biodegrade and are a much much better option but...\n\nThey suck soooo much. I've never even gotten past more than a few sips of a drink before they get sticky, soft, and pulp has leaked into my drink. And God forbid you try and drink something warm.\n\nWhen my campus got rid of plastic straws and replaced then with paper I openly supported the move, but deep down I wish they never did so o could ignorantly slip to my hearts content\n\nArchived post.

Take the lid off and drink it 🤷\n\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI think the damage that plastic straws cause is grossly exaggerated. They're not banned here yet but they've started taxing plastic bags and replacing them with paper shit bags.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n5 yr. ago\nnervousmelon\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nNot to mention that paper straws aren't even that much better.\n\nUnpopularOpinionMods\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nIs this a Popular or Unpopular opinion?
