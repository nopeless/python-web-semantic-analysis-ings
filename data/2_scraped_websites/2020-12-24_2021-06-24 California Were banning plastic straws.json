Then they realized that slapping arbitrary charges on an item is something that only the most galaxy-brained think is a brilliant idea. Then immediately put a stop to it.\n\ncustomer: ‘Can I have a plastic bag for my plastic phone card so I don’t lose it?’\n\nI can't stand those customers. Like, the fuck you want a bag for?! No doubt to try to steal. But I've had customers legit ask for a bag for the stupid card and throw it away. I do it, then they take it out of the bag and proceed to scratch it. It's like: \"Why did you even bother asking for a bag?!\"\n\nReply\nreply\nGingersnapped87\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThey always tell me it's because \"I don't want to look like I stole it\"\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/germany\nCan I just put plastic bottles in the yellow bag or what\n3 upvotes · 16 comments\nr/indonesia\nNuclear Power Plant in 2045\n100 upvotes · 89 comments\nr/AmazonDSPDrivers\nVlogger fired from Amazon after documenting a week as an Amazon delivery driver\nyoutube\n190 upvotes · 119 comments\nr/McDonalds\nWe got a look at the menu for CosMc's, McDonald's new spinoff\nbusinessinsider\n174 upvotes · 57 comments\nr/walmart\nNot I.
