That was my first thought too. Also hard plastic containers can be reused, soft plastic is the bigger issue but they seem fine with that? OP needs to do some research...\n\nReply\nreply\n13 more replies\nSST0617\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nGod this is rich given all of OP’s other comments. Didn’t know this and thank you for giving me a good chuckle at OP’s expense.\n\nReply\nreply\n37 more replies\ncarolineecouture\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nI feel like they are criticized no matter what. Nuts are now in plastic bags but people want the jars back. It seems like paper towels are no longer individually wrapped in the larger package and people don't like that either.\n\nThe idea was \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.\"\n\nI agree don't let the best be the enemy of the good.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nI have been reusing the plastic jar from the cashews - I realized they made the switch and saved the last one I bought. Just keep dumping the bags in when it’s time.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\n21 more replies\nWhurleyBurds\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nIf you want to reduce plastic usage, why are you even buying pods?\n\nReply\nreply\nConsciousMuscle6558\n•\n3 mo. ago\n•\nEdited 3 mo. ago\n\nI suspect moisture would be an issue if they were in boxes. You could always buy powdered detergent. If you don’t like a product or how it’s packaged then buy one you do. It doesn’t have to be from Costco. Plenty of places sell bulk items by weight. Just do a google search for environmentally friendly detergent. I also suspect Tide chooses how their products are packaged. Not Costco. Sometimes being an environmentalist requires effort and change on your part.\n\nReply\nreply\n6 more replies\nAndy89316\n•\n3 mo. ago\n•\nEdited 3 mo. ago\n\nCostco is doing a lot behind the scenes for the environment.

If the cardboard gets wet, you have a huge mess on your hands. I’m all for less plastic, but this is focusing on a leaf in a forest. The reasons other than price to use plastic. What would you prefer as packaging for the mixed nut? Paper and cardboard with absorb the oils and won’t last as long. Glass can get heavy from a transportation and customer convenience standpoint. If you are truly concerned about plastic consumption, I’m not sure Costco is the place for you.\n\nReply\nreply\nFearlessPark4588\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nDissolvable laundry detergent sheets is the ecologically friendly solution. You don't need pods, the approach to solving the problem isn't the best way of thinking about it. Why put pods in a paper box when you could use sheets?\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nHuntersDaughtersMuff\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nbut this is focusing on a leaf in a forest.\n\nmore like a fart in the wind.\n\nIf you are truly concerned about plastic consumption, I’m not sure Costco is the place for you.\n\nof course that's true, but don't expect the behavior to change.

Do you realize how hypocritical it is to complain about using plastic in a product that is individually wrapped in plastic? If this was actually a concern you would not be using laundry pods in the first place.\n\nReply\nreply\n20 more replies\nbored_ryan2\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nSo you’re concerned about plastic but use dishwasher pods that absolutely put micro plastics into the water?\n\nUse plain powder or liquid instead.\n\nReply\nreply\n18 more replies\nTourmalineTart\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nI agree here, but also do see them making some strides. For example, the flat of Kirkland fizzy water no longer has the plastic six pack rings 6-pack, just the cans in the shrink wrap now.\n\nMoving to less plastic is key, and big retailers and brands have a huge impact\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nView more comments\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nRelated\nCostco\nPublic company\nConsumer staples sector\nS&P 500\nBusiness\nFinance\nBusiness, Economics, and Finance\nforward\nback\nr/bayarea\nBusinesses call for permanent clean-up of Oakland neighborhood\nyoutube\n187 upvotes · 49 comments\nr/bayarea\nPSA for dog owners: there's a novel canine respiratory illness circulating.
