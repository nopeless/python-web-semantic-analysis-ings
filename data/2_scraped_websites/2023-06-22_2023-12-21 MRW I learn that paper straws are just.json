You can blame tires, synthetic fabrics and brushes, and bottled water (especially the caps) and it would account for the vast majority of the problem. Banning plastic straws is like popping a pimple to cure your cancer.",

Articles like the one this is based on* are disingenuous and frustrating in misrepresenting the purpose for certain measures in order to claim that the measure isn't effective. The concern was marine life consuming plastic straws. That concern is alleviated by straw alternatives.\n\nReply\nreply\nAxisNine\n‚Ä¢\n3 mo. ago\n\nClassic use of ‚Äòwhataboutism‚Äô to create outrage and clicks.

One cigarette butt can contaminate something like 300 gallons of fresh water! It‚Äôs awful!\n\nThe habit is gross enough as it is, I‚Äôm aware of how nasty it smells to others and what it does to me. For that reason, I try to be as courteous as possible. Stay away from people who aren‚Äôt also smoking, do my best to hide it if a child happens to pass by, and I‚Äôm THAT guy, shaking my fist at the clouds as I pick up butts that are literally right next to the butt can‚Ä¶ drives me nuts!\n\nI‚Äôll be quitting soon‚Ä¶ one vice at a time‚Ä¶ but in the interim‚Ä¶ this smoker refuses to litter, especially my butts.\n\nReply\nreply\nDe5perad0\n‚Ä¢\n3 mo. ago\n\nThe solution is NO straws.\n\nIf you NEED a straw you can carry a metal one there are a lot of options.\n\nBut 99% of people do NOT need a straw and 95% of people could care less if they have one or not.\n\nReply\nreply\nThick-Equipment6185\n‚Ä¢\n3 mo. ago\n\nWhat about boba?\n\nReply\nreply\n11 more replies\nBellyUptotheClouds\n‚Ä¢\n3 mo. ago\n\nThe solution is to stop thinking that the onus is on individuals to undo the pollution created by unregulated corporations and elect progressives who aren't beholden to them for funding to put such regulations in place.\n\nReply\nreply\n7 more replies\n78 more replies\nCJ_BARS\n‚Ä¢\n3 mo. ago\n\nI sip from the cup like a big boy!\n\nReply\nreply\n11 more replies\nSgtSharki\n‚Ä¢\n3 mo. ago\n\nMaybe people just shouldn't be using disposable straws in general.\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\nShermanBallZ\n‚Ä¢\n3 mo. ago\n\nBut they don't hurt sea turtles.
