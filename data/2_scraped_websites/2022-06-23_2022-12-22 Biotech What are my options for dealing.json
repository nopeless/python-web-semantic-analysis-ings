I started two tiles away from an 84% cloud, and before being able to land it warned me with \"acid fog will occur roughly every 162 days on this tile due to nearby pollution\".",

Deal with em after global warming.\n\nNetLibrarian\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nHadn't thought about that, but one of these new mech controllers would kind of be ez mode for ice sheet games.\n\nOnly one mouth to feed, robots that don't care about cold doing most of the work, and an eternally frozen wasteland to throw toxic wastepacks into.\n\nShazzamon\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThe distance for dropping wastepacks seems to very large - even at 16 tiles away I was still angering a nearby faction. Maybe 20-30 tiles?\n\nEventually you can get a Wastepack Atomizer through Advanced Fabrication, but it has a Nanochip item requirement, which IIRC are acquired from one of the boss mechanoids?\n\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\nNetLibrarian\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nFrom what I read, you can freeze them.\n\nYou can haul them off and drop them somewhere.\n\nI think you might be able to make a waste dump and contain them if you let them rupture.\n\nYou can burn them and force them to rupture.\n\nAllowing the land to become polluted has some upsides, including growing a type of flower that will -eventually- consume all the pollution near it.\n\nLate game there are some ways to dispose of them cleanly at a high energy cost.\n\nChitsa_Chosen\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nAre packs flammable? Try burning them. In open or in stone room.\n\nNetLibrarian\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThe previews said that they explode if you do that, spreading pollution, toxic gas, and risking the possibility of an infestation being called.\n\nLazerMagicarp\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThere are some gene mods that make you almost immune to toxins and pollution but you either starve due to unstable metabolism or have a serious debuff.\n\nStrangerAlways\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nAlso no food can love in that environment\n\n2 more replies\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/RimWorld\nJailbreak\n1.8K upvotes · 62 comments\nr/RimWorld\nNSFW\nhelp\n1.5K upvotes · 143 comments\nr/RimWorld\nAn extremely one-sided battle.\n1.4K upvotes · 55 comments\nr/RimWorld\nI can explain...\n1.4K upvotes · 144 comments\nr/RimWorld\nI managed to perpetually contain a hive by keeping it at 180C.
