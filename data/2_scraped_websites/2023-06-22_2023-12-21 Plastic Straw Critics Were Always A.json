Plus, the death of Yvegeny Prigozhin was confirmed by his ol' pal Putin. And an interview with Guy Nattiv on his new film, Golda.\n\npodcasts.apple.com\nOpen\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nMuck_Mire\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nMike Pesca is usually cautious about hype surrounding a study (https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19440049.2023.2240908). But he loves plastic straws so much he did not apply his usual skeptical approach.\nI will invoke the spirit of Maria Konnikova and call bullshit on the headlines and on the statement that “A new study shows that paper and bamboo straws are WORSE for the environment and the human body than plastic straws.”\n\nFirst, the paper does not provide significant evidence that paper straws have more PFAS than plastic straws.\n\nIn fact, the paper explicitly says “ΣPFAS concentrations did not differ significantly among the different materials (p = 0.245).” There is an “absence of significant differences in ΣPFAS concentrations among types of straws.”\n\nThey studied 20 paper straws, 5 bamboo, and 4 plastic. 18/20 paper, 4/5 bamboo, and 3/4 plastic had PFAS. Given the small sample sizes, they cannot actually assert paper or bamboo are more likely to have PFAS than plastic. (In fact, two of the plastic straws had more PFAS measured than about half of the paper straws.)\n\nAs Maria Konnikova always warned Mr. Pesca: look out for small sample sizes!\n\nSecond, it is notable that the news stories reporting on this paper did not mention the amount of PFAS found. Most straws had under 2 ng/g. (ng/g = ppb = μg.L-1.) What does this mean?\n\nThe EPA has recently proposed a regulation calling for enforcement of water supplies so that they have less than 4 ppt or ng/L. (https://www.epa.gov/sdwa/and-polyfluoroalkyl-substances-pfas).\n\nLet’s translate this into the official “bullshit” amount of water (Gist episode 10/15/2014), your daily doze of eight - 8oz glasses of water (about 2 liters). So, EPA’s proposed standard limits drinking water to 8 ng/day.\n\nTo put it another way, chewing up and eating a straw might expose you to less PFAS than the EPA currently thinks is OK for you to drink every day from your municipal water supply.\n\nWhich relates to the third reason I call bullshit. The study did nothing to study actual exposure to PFAS from these straws. They put the straw material in a solution and vibrated them and then shook them for a day. I know we all hate a soggy paper straw; no one is stirring their lemonade for 12 hours before drinking it!\n\nFinally, the implication of finding PFAS in these straws, if any, is that we should consider regulating PFAS exposure from manufacturing in all products. It is not about paper vs. plastic.\n\nReply\nreply\nMuck_Mire\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nP.S. BS: The same basic result was reported two years ago, but these student-authors wanted to check out straws being sold in Belgium.\n\nReply\nreply\nShoddyWeekend16\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nThe direct ingestion aspect is part of the issue, but the main point is that when they are disposed of the chemicals are then forever in the environment.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nShoddyWeekend16\n•\n3 mo. ago\n•\nEdited 3 mo. ago\n\nI wanted to raise a couple points with the straw issue; the use of alternate straws, but I think more importantly is the argument Mike uses. First, some of the study results just don’t make sense and if I was conducting it, would lead me to deeply question the whole process. If a small manufacturer of bamboo straws shows their manufacturing process that doesn’t have any interaction with any chemical, let alone the forever chemicals, what is going on here? The authors acknowledged that the plant based straws could have come in contact with the chemicals during the growth process. But also, with bamboo specifically, it’s naturally water resistant, it literally lives every day in contact with water, why would any manufacturer add another process that requires the purchase and application of chemicals unnecessarily? That’s just a waste of money, it’s bad business. A better study would have begun at the source and included the aggregation of raw materials, the manufacturing process, and the shipping process if one exists.\n\nThe biggest issue I had with this segment was not with Mike’s stance on straws, but with his argument. He repeatedly states the insignificance of the impact plastic straws have. This is a pernicious mindset to have, to think that because something exists in small amounts that it shouldn’t be addressed. (Isn’t this the exact problem we have with forever chemicals?) The entire technological advancement of the human race is because of small incremental changes. The automobile didn’t just pop into existence. Humans didn’t just evolve to increase our life expectancy. Advancements in one area certainly have potential to impact other areas as those ideas are translated to new uses. If we can make better straws why wouldn’t we? If plastic straws are only .03% of the plastic waste. That’s still millions of tons. Extrapolate that impact to 8 billion people, now what’s the impact? If it’s ignored it further accumulates over time. Personally, I’ll never be carrying around a bamboo or metal straw, I’d rather go without. Mike can just say he doesn’t care, that he’s going to use plastic straws regardless, but why argue to ignore this issue as insignificant?\n\nReply\nreply\nSpectacularGobsmack\n•\n3 mo. ago\n\nShoddyWeekend16, this is what I came here to say. The argument of that the impact is a small percent of (some) whole isn’t useful. A doctor can and should save a life even if that death would be a small fraction of 1% of the deaths that day. That argument is of no value.\n\nThe better argument is, like for reusable bags, the more permanent consumer item is higher polluting than the disposable one. No reusable bag can survive the number of reuses it would need to offer before it came out cheaper than the disposable ones. Replacing disposable straws with sturdier ones isn’t useful.\n\nBut I’d argue replacing disposable straws with no straws, for the people who didn‘t need a straw in the first place, would be useful. As would not throwing a full compliment of plastic wrapped cutlery in my bag whether I ask or not. All around, we could start by not assuming that we need to throw a disposable, wrapped bit of plastic at people every time they order something. It would be an admittedly small step (but worth it!) to correcting our consumerist, wasteful habits.\n\nReply\nreply\nleroyjabari\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nI agree the replacement of straws was always a bad idea, but certain straw applications that were removed like with the Starbucks sippy cups for persons without a disability that prevents them from using it is not the worst thing in the world. Maybe a more nuanced argument is warranted as you always call for Mike\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 16%\nRank by size \nr/TheGist\nShould Mike just avoid the legal and semantic arguments around Israel/Palestine for now?\n26 upvotes · 35 comments\nr/TheGist\nNathan Thrall Interview\n19 upvotes · 53 comments\nr/TheGist\nMike was incredibly disingenuous in the last episode\n13 upvotes · 63 comments\nr/TheGist\nMike's coverage of the Israel/Palestine conflict has been great\n10 upvotes · 1 comment\nr/TheGist\nBefore you completely lose interest in Israel...\n10 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/TheGist\nFree speech on campus\n8 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/TheGist\nGold and Crypto ads…\n6 upvotes · 16 comments\nr/TheGist\n\"Vast Labyrinth\" Or \"Box Of Dates\"?\npodcasts.apple\n6 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/TheGist\nEvery Little Thing Xi Does Is Tragic\npodcasts.apple\n6 upvotes · 3 comments\nr/TheGist\nWhen Rewrites Go Wrong\npodcasts.apple\n5 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/TheGist\nDoes Donald Trump Still Know How To Talk: An Investigation\npodcasts.apple\n4 upvotes · 2 comments\nr/TheGist\nBEST OF THE GIST: Misused Political Slogan Edition\npodcasts.apple\n4 upvotes"
