  "body": "MengerianMango Advice Guru [92] â€¢ 7 yr. ago. There's not much you can do. You'd have to take the gas tank off to get it out. The straw alone shouldn't be enough to plug the fuel pump, but, if it dissolves, then it might plug the fuel pump filter. If it does, then you're going to have to have that replaced, which also requires removing the tank.",

Tried to keep the little sealer open, straw fell in. Can this result in some issues? What should I do?\n\nArchived post.

You'd have to take the gas tank off to get it out. The straw alone shouldn't be enough to plug the fuel pump, but, if it dissolves, then it might plug the fuel pump filter. If it does, then you're going to have to have that replaced, which also requires removing the tank. (There is the possibility that it could dissolve completely enough to go through the filter. I'm assuming that, if that happens, the plastic solute will pass through the engine without damaging anything. That seems likely because it should be in insignificant concentration.)\n\nI'd say wait and see. If it quits, then you'll be out some money to fix it, but not much more than if you had someone preventively extract the straw.\n\n4 more replies\n \nr/Advice\nUpdate: my son tried to kill his sister.
