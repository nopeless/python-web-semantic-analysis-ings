However, the stupid cheap plastic tightener straps broke on both of them. I've called Nike to ask about getting them fixed and was told there's nothing they can do. I'm an optimist and a realist, I know there's got to be a way to fix these instead of buying a new pair! Any ideas?\n\nHere's what they look like. Specifically, they're Nike N-dorfin 4s.\n\nArchived post.

You should be able to fix that by replacing it with a new one. You probably have to drill out the old one since most of them are attached with rivets. Here is a razor buckle replacement that could fit your skates.\n\nThere are plenty other buckle replacements manufacturers but I think razor would be the cheapest one\n\n \nTop 2%\nRank by size \nr/SmarterEveryDay\nThis TRANSPARENT ENGINE is Fascinating (How Engines Work) - Smarter Every Day 292\nyoutube\n203 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/mealtimevideos\nTrapping 200 Scammers in an Impossible Maze [22:31]\nyoutube\n152 upvotes · 12 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
