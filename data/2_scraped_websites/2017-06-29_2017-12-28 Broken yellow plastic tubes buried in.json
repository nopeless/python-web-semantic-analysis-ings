This one had a rigid plastic straw inside.\nArchived post.

I always just assumed they were some sort of toy (I'm always finding marbles, action figures, etc.) and threw them away. They usually are around the fence line where the easement is.\n\nWhen I pulled this one out the plastic was kind of brittle and a piece of the end broke off. An amber colored straw was sticking out and I pulled that part out. The straw is the same type of material and diameter as those crazy straws. It almost looks like scorch marks inside.\n\nsdforbda\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nNo clue but a few things I can think of could be time released pest repellents or weed killers or something. Was going to guess that it could be a pet pee post but I've never seen one like that.\n\nBogusSolution\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nIt looks like a rain gauge, the marks on the straw should match up with your locations SI units (inches or centimeters).\n\nlavalaugher\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nA straw\n\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/DeepIntoYouTube\nThis man inflates inner tubes until they explode and uploads a new explosion video every day\nyoutube\n125 upvotes · 30 comments\nr/CatastrophicFailure\nThe Aggie Bonfire Collapse | November 18, 1999 | College Station, TX (Fascinating Horror)\nyoutube\n295 upvotes · 32 comments\nr/raspberry_pi\nYou can use external GPUs on the Raspberry Pi 5 - Jeff Geerling\nyoutube\n121 upvotes · 19 comments\nPROMOTED\nr/Machinists\nInteresting/scary way to increase your swing.
