Every single video from stufferdb is loading so slowly for me it renders almost everything unwatchable. Even if I wait and let it buffer for some time, it always get to the point where I have to wait several seconds to load a second of the video.\nIs this a global issue or just my problem? If it's not global, has anyone experienced this and is there a fix? My internet speed is 100 MB/s so the problem is not there.\n\nu/89throwaway8989\nâ€¢\n2 yr. ago\nlongest video?\nSite Questions\n\njust wanna know where the longest video is\n\nu/Traditional-Ad5655\nâ€¢\n2 yr. ago\nDoes Laura lee have any more than the 5 videos on this website?\nu/ChickenChipotleMelt\nâ€¢\n2 yr. ago\nDoes StuffersDB completely devour anyone else's data for the month?\n\nI would like to start off by saying I watched maybe one or two videos and not even all the way, I skipped through them and maybe some pictures too, yet my bandwidth shows over 125+ gigs of data being used. The night before that, I had 250+ gigs of usage. I used to notice that StufferDB would use a lot of data a long time ago but I figured it was a fluke but now I'm seeing that this may be directly linked to StufferDB since it seems to always spike when I go on there. Anyone else have this issue even when they do not watch many videos on there?\n\nu/Lightrunner2004\nâ€¢\n2 yr. ago\nIs the website down for anybody else?\n\nJust tried going on the website on was met with a blank white screen.
