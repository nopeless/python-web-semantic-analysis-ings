If you were rather far away from the city lights, it's very well possible that the flickering comes from turbulent warmer regions of air between the lights and you.",

Is there a scientific explanation for this besides light pollution?\n\nArchived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.\nSort by:\noss1x\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nA city is constantly heating air (from sewers, buildings etc) which is then rising up. As these streams of warmer air are rather turbulent, they change paths all the time. Hot air has lower density and thus lower refractive index than colder air, so a pocket of warmer air will slightly distort the path light takes from its source to your eye.\n\nIf you were rather far away from the city lights, it's very well possible that the flickering comes from turbulent warmer regions of air between the lights and you.\n\n1 more reply\n \n16\nRank by size \nRelated\nScience\nforward\nback\nr/Python\nWhat the Heck Are Monads?!\nyoutube\n130 upvotes · 52 comments\nr/raspberry_pi\nYou can use external GPUs on the Raspberry Pi 5 - Jeff Geerling\nyoutube\n120 upvotes · 19 comments\nr/Documentaries\nWhy Decentralization Matters (2021) - Big tech companies were built off the backbone of a free and open internet.
