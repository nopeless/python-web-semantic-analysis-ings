What kind of drug use could this point to?\nOther\n\nWe found about 35 weed baggies, 3 gravity bongs, various paraphernalia and cut straws (that when we showed them to him he took them and threw them in his car, telling us we didn't know what we were talking about).

Like melted the straw and pinched/pressed to seal the opening? The slant is to assist with scooping out, normally, a powdery street narcotic like Cocaine/Meth from a baggy.
