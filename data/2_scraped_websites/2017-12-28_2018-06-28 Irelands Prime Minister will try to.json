Will he raise the issue in public? If so is it just an attempt to cause a negative reaction from the LGBT \"community\"? Will the conversation be private or will exchange be broadcast by the Prime Minister? What's the exact point of the exercise save that of just finding a new strategy at Trump bashing, division and conflict.\n\nHow does the opinion of either gentleman matter in the least except ripping the scab off wounds? I smell a rat.\n\nAlternatively, is the august Prime Minister just attempting to reinforce his constituency's support? Isn't this a form of meddling that shouldn't be permitted between sovereign nations? It's not fair to leverage such a visit for his own benefit at home.\n\nBesides, what good is such an announcement? It's like saying, \"I'm coming to your country to embarrass you. Let's talk, pal.\" Something stinks herein.\n\n \n5\nRank by size \nRelated\nWorld News\nforward\nback\nr/worldnews\nAntony Blinken offers 'unwavering support' for Guyana amid Venezuelan annexation plan\nupi\n513 upvotes · 65 comments\nr/worldnews\nIsrael shares full list of Palestinians to be released in hostage deal\nnewsweek\n2.1K upvotes · 674 comments\nr/worldnews\nMagnitude 7.5 earthquake strikes Mindanao, Philippines\nreuters\n244 upvotes · 13 comments\nr/worldnews\nVirgin Atlantic completes first long-haul flight fully powered by sustainable fuel\ncnbc\n190 upvotes · 46 comments\nr/worldnews\nLaos is spiraling toward a debt crisis as China looms large.\ncnbc\n153 upvotes · 27 comments\nr/worldnews\nSurgeons perform world’s first eye transplant on man who suffered electric shock\nlbc.co.uk\n854 upvotes · 42 comments\nr/worldnews\nTantric yoga guru Gregorian Bivolaru charged with human trafficking\ntheguardian\n145 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/worldnews\n'Argentina has non-negotiable sovereignty over the Falklands', country's new right-wing president Javier Milei declares\nlbc.co.uk\n12K upvotes · 2.8K comments\nr/worldnews\nCountries meet in Kenya to thrash out global plastic pollution treaty\ntheguardian\n283 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/worldnews\nPhilippines considers return to 'fold' of International Criminal Court\nreuters\n90 upvotes · 1 comment\nr/worldnews\nFalkland's sovereignty 'not up for discussion' Britain warns after new Argentinian president vows to 'get them back'\nlbc.co.uk\n5.1K upvotes · 847 comments\nr/worldnews\nThe world briefly smashed through the 2-degree warming limit for the first time ever\ncnn\n939 upvotes · 227 comments\nr/worldnews\nWorld to hit 1.4C of warming in record hot 2023\nreuters\n191 upvotes · 49 comments\nr/worldnews\nClimate-heating gases reach record highs, UN reports\ntheguardian\n158 upvotes · 12 comments\nr/worldnews\nGlobal talks to cut plastic waste stall as industry and environmental groups clash\nnpr.org\n108 upvotes · 6 comments\nr/worldnews\nFormer PM David Cameron is introduced to the House of Lords as Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton\nlbc.co.uk\n976 upvotes · 249 comments\nr/worldnews\nFirst-ever images prove 'lost echidna' not extinct\nbbc\n379 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/worldnews\nWorld behind on almost every policy required to cut carbon emissions, research finds\ntheguardian\n382 upvotes · 39 comments\nr/worldnews\nNottingham City Council declares itself effectively bankrupt\nbbc\n99 upvotes · 23 comments\nr/worldnews\nEU is ill-equipped to meet growing global threats\nreuters\n192 upvotes · 52 comments\nr/worldnews\nColombia joins international alliance calling for treaty to end use of fossil fuels\ntheguardian\n215 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/worldnews\nFormer Hong Kong activist Agnes Chow flees territory for Canada | Hong Kong\ntheguardian\n406 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/worldnews\nOil prices on track for fourth straight week of declines\nreuters\n263 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/worldnews\n‘We have to work urgently’: Mexican ecologists start campaign to save axolotl | Mexico\ntheguardian\n1.7K upvotes · 48 comments\nr/worldnews\nColombia passes ambitious ‘junk food law’ to tackle lifestyle diseases | Global development\ntheguardian\n403 upvotes · 59 comments\nTOP POSTS\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of March 14, 2018\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of March 2018\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2018"
