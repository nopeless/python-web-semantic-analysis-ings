They also said that having clean drinking water is a privilege not a right. So yea, not surprised there.\n\nReply\nreply\ndayafterpi\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nits like they're sooo focused on that bottom line that they dont realize how stupid their greenwashing is.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n1 more reply\ntaldarus\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI remember a time when plastic straws came in paper packaging.\n\nWe have come full circle.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n2 yr. ago\nsiouxze\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nNext time don't buy nestle\n\nReply\nreply\npiedpipr\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nThat itty bit of plastic is nothing. Not even in one gram of waste. Now consider…\n\n… the carton’s inner lining is made of Plastic. The machinery used to manufacture it is Plastic and Plastic waste. The transportation of the carton uses Plastic wrap and Plastic trays. The semi-truck uses petroleum fuel to ship it to the store. Finally, the disposal of the used carton uses Plastic trash bags. Removed by a petroleum-fueled garbage truck… etc etc\n\nThe problem of Plastic is the entire chain of production. From oil extraction to landfill. Not straws.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nNestle ???

How would you ensure I didn’t sneeze on your straw about 15 times before you put it in your mouth?\n\nGenuinely curious on how one would protect a paper straw lol.\n\nReply\nreply\nbloodmusthaveblood\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nThey could just redesign the packaging to not require a straw.. like a milk carton\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n13 more replies\nworkaholic828\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nIt’s tough because they have to put the straw in something, you can’t just let it hang.\n\nReply\nreply\nbloodmusthaveblood\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nThey could just get rid of the straw altogether and redesign the packaging to not require one\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nKuhlerTuep\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nr/fucknestle\n\nReply\nreply\nastromech_dj\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nr/maliciouscompliance\n\nReply\nreply\nJackDostoevsky\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nthis feels a little like splitting hairs: the entire beverage you're holding is a consumption nightmare. the plastic around the straw is probably the least destructive or polluting part of that entire drink. (don't forget, the cardboard material that had to make the box involved cutting down trees, and these things are usually lined with some sort of plastic on the inside, so it's not like the box is recyclable at all)\n\ninstead of buying something that was produced thousands of miles from you, requiring a long chain of fossil-fuel driven logistics (and not to mention how shitty of a company Nestle is), maybe... opt for a different beverage? like a glass of water perhaps?\n\nyou could at least buy something in an aluminum can, because aluminum is one of the most recyclable materials on the planet.\n\nReply\nreply\nView more comments\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/deadandcompany\nWrigley - pot situation\n4 upvotes · 8 comments\nr/Supplements\nHow safe is NOW Foods vitamins?
