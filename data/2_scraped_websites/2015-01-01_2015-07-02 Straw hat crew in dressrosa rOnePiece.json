With Luffy going off to fight in the Coliseum in the beginning of the month under the name Lucy no less it has left his crew this time to be the ones to cause turmoil and mischief throughout Dressrosa.\n\nUssop Robin and Franky befriended the Dwarfs with Ussop taking on a role of a legend in their eyes as after knocking out sugar in a way only Ussop could. they promised to build a statue of him next too Norland\n\nFranky lead the drawfs in the destruction of the factory and decided that the straw hats should work with them to free their brothern instead of just blowing up the factory\n\nThe swirley hat pirates have allegedly engaged in battle with the yonko big moms ship against some of her main officers\n\nUssop by freeing the toys and becoming God Ussop United all of the fighters from the arena behind the straw hat flag\n\nZoro dismantled Mountain Sized Pica in front of the entire Dressrosa It is the first Arc where it wasn't Luffy ability to gather allies it was his crews ability and they funneled that belief to their captain who ended up shouldering that burden off the love of his crew and friends alone\n\nRead more\nArchived post.

I had been down on this arc personally because I felt like it focused too much on non-straw hats but now that you lay it out this really has been an arc of evolution for the straw hats as a team\n\n3 more replies\nLucciDVergo\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\n\"beginning of the month\" if by that you mean March 2013, then yes.\n\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nDwarfs?

I would say that the Straw Hat crew gained most the allies themselves, where as Luffy only gained a few himself.\n\nLuffy helped Law, Rebecca, and Ex-Don Chinjao. Then later on gaining Cabbage's respect. Sanji got Violet, Zoro did something, Franky helped with Soldier-san, Robin with Revolutionaries/Rebecca. But it was really all God Ussop\n\nTL:DR \"All Thanks be to God Ussop. Praise the Nose. Amen\"\n\n2 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nUSOLAND!!!!! THE LEGENDARY HERO!!!!!!\n\ntigercool777\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nIt makes total sense. Luffy is not going to have people on his crew that are not as crazy as him, don't make allies like him, or don't inspire others. The entire strawhat crew desire for freedom and their determination to achieve their goals is what makes people like them so much.\n\ndokem\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nvery nice point. when usopp says \"dont worry and dont look back\" or smth its kind of symbolic for the whole spirit.\n\nStrawHatIan\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nHasn't the entire dressrosa arc happened in the span on 1 day?\n\n10 more replies\nSimpsDaGreat\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\n110% with you on this point brother.. good job\n\nCabbageTheVoice\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nSpoiler\n\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/OnePiece\nOne Piece and The NFL's Los Angeles Rams will have a collaboration on December 3rd!\ninstagram\n305 upvotes · 70 comments\nr/OnePunchMan\n[OC] Nameless insect Monster Sculpt Timelapse\nyoutube\n141 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/Dandadan\nAnime announcement\nyoutube\n1.1K upvotes · 113 comments\nr/OnePiece\nSPOILER\nKatakuri's interesting backstory revealed in the latest Vivre Card Databook.\n119 upvotes · 52 comments\nr/hajimenoippo\nTotally Not Mark Reviews Hajime no Ippo: East Japan Rookie Tournament\nyoutube\n255 upvotes · 61 comments\nr/BlueLock\nBlue Lock: Episode Nagi, New Trailer!\nyoutube\n112 upvotes · 18 comments\nr/dragonball\nDragon Ball: Sparking!
