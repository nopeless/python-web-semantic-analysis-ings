There are others that use proprietary interfaces like the revision vipers, but you may have a harder time accessorizing them. IMO a helmet and plates are two things you should never buy used, always new so you know what you're getting. I use the hoplite personally and love it.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nYou can buy them from plenty of places, but it depends specifically on what you're looking for, Gentex/Ops Core, Team Wendy, Highcom, websites like Optactical and a few others stock them as well.\n\nReply\nreply\nLutonFire\n•\n2 yr. ago\nsunny8513\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nCurious also\n\nReply\nreply\nMactosin\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nPrimary arms had some ballistic helmets on sale yesterday.
