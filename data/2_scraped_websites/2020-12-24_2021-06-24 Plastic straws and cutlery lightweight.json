Paper straws are godawful, the feel terrible and it‚Äôs a race to finish your drink before they collapse into a sodden mess.\n\n42wheels\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nBamboo straws?\n\n2 more replies\n17 more replies\n[deleted]\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\nwasabibinchicken\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nWhat shits me are the thick plastic bags. Ban the thin shopping bags, that lots of people used as garbage bags (that yes agree, needed to go) and they‚Äôve instead replaced them with thick plastic bags that are probably even worse for the environment, can‚Äôt even be used decently as garbage bags and let‚Äôs be honest- just end up in the bin. What a stupid replacement.\n\n1 more reply\ndreadedstrayan\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nSo they ban useful plastic products like plates and cutlery but I can still buy some tomato's on a plastic tray, in a sealed plastic bag that sit next to the loose tomato's but they don't see that as wasteful?\n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with these people.\n\n1 more reply\nunconfirmedpanda\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nI am absolutely furious that no one seems to listen to or acknowledge that people with certain disabilities NEED plastic straws. The alternatives do not work for them. Educate the general public into making smart, responsible decisions so that people who NEED plastic single-use items can have them.\n\nPlastic straws are the damn scapegoat when the real issue is industrial and commercial waste.\n\n7 more replies\nWink-\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nI never used to buy garbage bags for my bins at home because I would just reuse the plastic shopping bags Coles/Woolies provided as part of my grocery shopping.\n\nNow that they don't, I'm still using the same amount of plastic, but now I have to pay Glad (or whatever) to get some rubbish bags.\n\nAlex_Kamal\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n‚Ä¢\nEdited 3 yr. ago\n\nYou'd be surprised how many people just threw those bags away though.\n\nI now get enough bags from the odd takeaway order but before hand we would be overflowing with them so would chuck them out.\n\nupx\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nWe also used plastic shopping bags for garbage and I though we would have to buy garbage bags. But there seem to be so many smaller bags (e.g., bread, chips) that we still have a bag full of plastic bags under the sink.\n\n2 more replies\n2 more replies\nThippusHorribilus\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nMy family was given a few sets of stainless steel straws for Christmas and they are awesome and a bargain! I have a set in the car and in the kitchen. Much better than the silicone ones.\n\neldaygo\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nBe careful not to fall on it. I remember ready that some woman died after tripping and falling onto here stew straw. It went through her eye from memory\n\n2 more replies\nSirBoboGargle\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/ny90m4/thailand_supermarket_ditches_plastic_packaging/\n\nSarcasmCupcakes\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nThere are numerous pieces from disabled people on why plastic straws are the best for them.\n\nOh, and 100 conglomerates are responsible for 71% of global emissions. But sure, straws.\n\nAnonymousEngineer_\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nIt's like shopping bags - the single use items they used to give you to bring groceries are evil and need to be banned. But if you pay $3.50 for a roll of fifty of the same item, labelled as \"bin liners\", it's all fine.\n\nMeanwhile, there's an increasingly large number of people chomping at the bit impatiently for their next overseas holiday, which has been delayed due to coronavirus. Because jumping on a Dreamliner or A380 is perfectly environmentally friendly.\n\nTotZoz_VFX\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nWe should ban fishing.
