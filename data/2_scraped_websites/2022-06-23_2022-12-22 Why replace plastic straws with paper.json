We can't stop using plastics but we should minimize the use wherever and however we can.\n\n4 more replies\nFabulousDave2112\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nBecause straws are actually uniquely dangerous. They can't be recycled at all because of their size and shape, so they're guaranteed to go in the garbage while cups at least CAN be recycled even if they often aren't. Straws can travel great distances on the wind and in bodies of water, and their shape is perfect for animals to choke on or get stuck in various body orifices. They're basically one of humanity's nightmare inventions, and despite the apparent pointlessness in the reduction of plastic use, they are exponentially more of a threat to the environment than the cups themselves.\n\nObviously getting rid of all single use plastic is essential, but straws are far more dangerous than cups so it's a huge step.\n\nberlandiera\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nThank you.
