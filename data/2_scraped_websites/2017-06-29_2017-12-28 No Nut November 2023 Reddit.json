A simple \"Still IN\" or \"I'm OUT‚Äù is all you need to comment, but feel free to unleash your inner thoughts or creative writing skills in the comments! They will always be posted on 12:00 AM, North American Eastern Standard Time (I ain't the mod, so I can post whenever I want).\n\n2. Extra Reminders\n\nThe Sexual Health Research Laboratory at Queen‚Äôs University in Kingston, Ontario, Canada is seeking individuals for an online study on No Nut November. Participants must be 18 years of age or older, currently be living in Canada, be able to read, write, and speak in English, and be comfortable answering questions about your sexuality and health (mental and physical). Online survey participation will take approximately 30-40 minutes. Prize draw available. If you are interested in participating or would like more information, you can visit the attached link, visit sexlab.ca/participate, or contact the Sexual Health Research Laboratory at sex.lab@queensu.ca**.

Everyone came in with different goals and those who endured until the end of the month came out stronger than ever before. We lost a lot of soldiers along the way but in the end, we came together as one big community. Praising each other‚Äôs success, lifting those up that wanted to give up, offering wisdom, making memories. Those that didn‚Äôt make it, don‚Äôt feel bad, mistakes happen. You can always reclaim yourself. You don‚Äôt even have to wait until NEXT November. It‚Äôs time to return home and go back to our normal lives. I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre gonna do once this sub closes, but no matter what it is, I wish you the very best.\n\nIt‚Äôs been an honor serving with you all, and I‚Äôll see y‚Äôall on the other side!\n\nu/crunchypillooww\n‚Ä¢\n5 days ago\nIt is time to say goodbye\nu/EpicCoolBoyOfficial\n‚Ä¢\n5 days ago\nBefore this subreddit will close, how's this guys today btw?\nu/ULTIMGAMINGOFFICIAL\n‚Ä¢\n5 days ago\nGoodbye everyone\nu/The-Real-Dankuya\n‚Ä¢\n5 days ago\nits been an honor to once again being on this war, see ya on the Camp Cumrade again on October 23, 2024!\nu/AdLegitimate806\n‚Ä¢\n5 days ago\nSee you guys in 2024, take care and have a great Christmas/New year's\nMeme\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/see-you-guys-in-2024-take-care-and-have-a-great-christmas-v0-fygvwz45ak4c1.gif?width=498&auto=webp&s=928c12a2a821e597a101b1ebee6e82f864b7d9e7\n\nLast year someone posted a Luigi image before the sub closed.
