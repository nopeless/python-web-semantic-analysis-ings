People use plastic straws to drink them. It's just a little piece of plastic, you think, not a big deal, right?\n\nAccording to Eco Cycle, each day there are more than 500 million plastic straws consumed in the United States alone. It's not so much “a little piece of plastic\" now, is it? There are 8-12 million tons of plastic released into the ocean. One common item found was the plastic straw. It is clear that something must be done to limit this problem.\n\nAs you may already know, the fight against plastic straws is slow-going. As an average individual, what can you and I do to contribute to this fight? The optimal way would be to stop using straws altogether, but straw drinking has become such a habit for many of us. With this understanding, EQUO offers high-quality alternatives to plastic straws. We divide these options into 4 groups:\nNatural straws\nReusable straws\nBiodegradable straws\nEdible straws\nThe first alternative to plastic straws is natural straws. These types of biodegradable straws come directly from nature and don’t need to be manufactured! Here are a couple of options:\n\n\nPapaya Leaf Stem Straws\n\nYou read that right! We are talking about real papaya leaves from papaya trees. When papaya leaves come to the end of their life-cycle, they change their color into yellow and fall on the ground. Stalks taken from these leaves can then be used as straws. The inner diameter is much larger than a common single-use straw and is suitable for drinking smoothies, milkshakes, and bubble tea. If you are lucky to live near the area growing papaya trees, this would be a wonderful plastic straw alternatives to choose.\n\nBamboo Straws\n\nConventional (plastic) straws not only affect your health but also fill the earth with excess waste. Why don't we start to use bamboo straws? This biodegradable straw is 100% handmade, contains no chemicals, and is dishwasher safe.\nWith nearly unlimited resources (bamboo is known for its fast growth) and compostable in a relatively short amount of time, these environmentally friendly straws can become a new hero in the fight against plastic. Using bamboo straws will, however, require you to carry around a brush to fight bacteria growth and mold as they can easily trap moisture.\n\n>> Read More: 5 Best Compostable Straws On The Market\n\nBiodegradable Paper Straws\n\nBiodegradable straws break down completely into nature without harming the environment. When such straws end their life in the ground, on the beach or at sea, fungus or bacteria will contribute to rapid decomposition breaking them into their natural components. Different materials will have a specific processing time. Some just need a few weeks, while others can take months, but they are all more favorable to mother nature than the traditional plastic straw. \n\nFrom the beginning of the fight against plastics, conservationists preferred using paper straws as a prime alternative to plastic straws. Paper straws are cheap and friendly to the environment. Yet, they are quickly soggy in liquid and, if you are a slow drinker like me, they can become very annoying!\nOn the plus side, they have various patterns, sizes, and colors. Paper straws are now available in many convenient stores and supermarkets. If paper straws are your thing, you’ll have plenty of fun options!\n\n\n\nWild Grass Straws\n\nThough this idea is not completely new, we have Mr. Tran Minh Tien to thank for bringing Vietnam grass straws back into the spotlight. This kind of straw is made of grey sage which only grows in the Mekong Delta. The stem of grey sage grass is tall and stiff making it the perfect straw! One little tip for our customers: before using, boil them with a pinch of salt to extend the life of the grass straw. Generally, wild grass straws are one-time use only but can be reused without problems.\n>> Read More:\n\nCoconut Straws: A Sustainable Alternative To Plastic Straws\nBiodegradable Sugarcane Straws For Drinks: How Are They Made?\nWhat Are Grass Straws? Why You Should Use Grass Straws | EQUO\nReusable Straws Made From Steel, Silicone, Glass\n\nThe materials to make these types of sustainable straws can vary widely. They can be made from stainless steel, silicone, glass, or other substances. Different materials will have different prices, and the price is often quite higher than natural straws or plastic straws. However, you can keep using it again without it disintegrating in water. Just prepare yourself with a brush tool and make sure to wash it and store it in a dry place. One benefit is that most reusable straws can be recycled.\n\nAmong those materials, stainless steel is the most popular because of the low cost and durability. Glass straws require delicate use, are temperature sensitive, and are not safe in dishwashers. Silicon may last for a lifetime, however, silicon straws are an ideal place for mold growth as moisture becomes trapped.\n>> Read More:\n\nCompostable Vs. Reusable Straws: Which One Is The Best Eco-Friendly Alternative\nWhy Should You Choose To Use Reuseable Straws? Pros & Cons From EQUO\nBiodegradable Wheat Straws\nThis is another smart and environmentally-savvy alternative to plastic straws. Why do we say so? Check out these awesome benefits:\nStrong, tall and stiff\nSafe in the microwave and refrigerator\nCan be used for hot drinks (up to 200 degrees F)\nChemical-free\nNo effect on taste\nCompostable within 6 months\nHelps the local economy\nOn the other hand, there are a few drawbacks to wheat straws. These include:\nLimited to one diameter size\nMay be difficult to use with smoothies, boba, etc.\nan have a strong straw smell\nEdible Rice Straws\nThe creativity never stops in our society. Using technology and some creative flavor - the edible straw was invented. After finishing your drink, take a bite out of the straw. Who wouldn’t want a pleasant taste coming from their straw? Although there are many items on this list, we chose 3 significant ones to introduce today.\nVietnam is known for its agricultural culture and is a top 3 exporter of rice worldwide. So it comes as no surprise at all that in 2018 a Vietnamese company created edible straws made from rice. The product included 80% rice flour while the remaining 20% is a combination of tapioca and wheat flour. Although this compostable straw is mainly rice flour, it doesn’t have to look monotonous. Plant colours (sesame seed, spinach, beetroot) are mixed in to add an interesting look. Rice straws can be stored for 18 months at room temperature and kept in liquids up to 2 hours.\n\n\nPasta Straws\nPasta straws have been gaining some traction over the last few years. They are made of simply wheat and water so they decompose quite quickly. They also don’t add taste to your drink and they hold their shape for long periods of time - especially in cold drinks. A few problems that exist with pasta straws include cost, current size limitation, and traditionally they are not gluten free.\n\n\nSugar Straws\nAs Vietnam is to the rice straw so is Spain to the sugar straw. In 2014, a Spanish bartender came up with the Sobors drinking straws with various flavors, like cinnamon, lime, ginger, and chocolate. The colder the beverage is, the longer these straws can stay solid. While sugar straws don’t last as long as some of the other alternatives mentioned, they can go up to 25 minutes without affecting the drink’s taste! They are 100% compostable within hours. After opening the box, customers can keep straws up to 2 years. These plant-based compostable straws are not great for those who have diabetes and the sugar can add unwanted calories to your drink. Keep these in mind as you determine if sugar straws will be a good fit for you.\n\nEQUO hopes the list above can start to help you choose some sustainable alternatives to plastic straws that work best for you. At EQUO, we know that small solutions can have a big impact.\n\nAdditional Sources:\nhttps://www.diffordsguide.com/encyclopedia/1405/cocktails/straws-10-alternatives-to-plastic-straws https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/alternatives-to-plastic-straws-eco-friendly/ https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/content/plastic-straw-use-bad-for-environment-oceans/ https://www.sheebamagazine.com/ecowalk/ecowalk-fighting-plastic-best-natural-drinking-straws-you-will-love/ https://nationswell.com/plastic-straw-alternatives http://www.worldcentric.org/about-compostables/materials/wheatstraw https://yourstrawbamboostraws.com/pages/about-us\nTags: biodegradable compostable straws, buy biodegradable straws, where to buy biodegradable straws, organic straws, eco friendly biodegradable straws, where to buy coffee straws, plasticless straws, compostable drinking straws, eco compostable straws, compostable straws\n18 Comments\nRobertanils\nhttps://gena-zajcev5.nethouse.ru/posts/mexamoskvichka-ru-2-kopiya-peez\nDustinSmige\nИнформационно правовой портал https://evromigracija.ru/ о жизни и работе в странах Европы. https://evromigracija.ru/\nMatthewGloge\nhttps://smoservice.club/\nRandom#Name[Ihoqebuqeqoprywu,2,5]\nDiscover the world of [url=https://velo1.live/velo-nicotine-pouches-uk/]velo uk[/url] with our exciting range of flavors!\nRobertNaL\nDiscover the exciting world of [url=https://velo1.live/velo-nicotine-pouches-uk/]velo nicotine pouches uk[/url] and enjoy our diverse range of flavors!\nRobertopify\nExplore the exciting world of [url=https://velo1.live/]velo[/url] with our incredible range of products!\nJessedog\nРєСѓРїРёС‚СЊ РіР°С€РёС€ РјР°СЂРёС…СѓР°РЅСѓ\nRobertNaL\nExplore the amazing world of [url=https://killapods.eu/product/velo-mint-slim/]velo product[/url] and savor its unique flavors!\nJessedog\n[url=https://newsruse.ru/ssylka-kraken-darknet-market.html]СЃСЃС‹Р»РєР° РєСЂР°РєРµРЅ РґР°СЂРєРЅРµС‚ РјР°СЂРєРµС‚[/url] [url=https://konditsioner-himki.ru/zakladki-narkotiki.html]Р·Р°РєР»Р°РґРєРё РЅР°СЂРєРѕС‚РёРєРё[/url] [url=https://eczane-satis.org/kraken-ssylka-vk2-top.html]РєСЂР°РєРµРЅ СЃСЃС‹Р»РєР° vk2 top[/url] [url=https://konditsioner-himki.ru/kraken-onion-net-kraken.html]kraken onion net kraken[/url] [url=https://vmoskalev.ru/kraken-zerkala-vk2-top.html]РєСЂР°РєРµРЅ Р·РµСЂРєР°Р»Р° vk2 top[/url]\nRandomNamemycle\nDiscover the exciting world of [url=https://killapods.eu/product/zyn-ginger-blood-orange/]zyn flavors[/url] and enjoy our diverse collection of flavors!\nRobertbroox\n[b]Ремонт пластиковых окон[/b] Всех приветствую!
