I mean sure, if you don't love chicken it's probably not the best place for you, but I can't think of a chain where you can order a healthier meal that tastes as good. This thread is archived.",

Sure the chicken is chicken but the sides are HORRIBLE for you but so so delicious.\n\n3 more replies\nKwhoisk\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThis was my favorite “fast food” place and I watched them open and quickly close locations for like a decade. Never understood why people chose shit food over this for the same price...\n\n[deleted]\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI only ate there a few times, and everything seemed super salty to me. I ate at a few different locations, so it probably wasn't just one.\n\nWhile it wasn't \"bad\", it certainly did seem uninspiring.\n\nUnpopularOpinionMods\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nIs this a Popular or Unpopular opinion?
