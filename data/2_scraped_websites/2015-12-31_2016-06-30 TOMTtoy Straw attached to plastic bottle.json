One of the prizes was this toy that was a hard plastic straw that ended in a small (maybe two inches tall) plastic coke bottle. The bottle was hollow and threaded through it was a string of yarn tied in a loop. When you blow into the straw, it makes the yard start circulating through the bottle in a giant loop.\n\nAnyone remember these? Can't find them online anywhere!\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nI remember these, so you are not going crazy, but for the life of me I can't remember what they were called. The yarns as like a polyester, right? Hmm. Do you remember the catalog? Maybe you can look up old catalogs for similar fundraising efforts. I am going to see if I can find some early 90s Oriental Trading Company scans, because they would have sold the same stuff as those prize catalogs, loosely.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nI'm so glad someone else remembers these! I think they probably were polyester or nylon. I remember they were rainbow-colored.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\njarvispeen\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nString Pipe Bottle.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nThat's it!
