The chat mixer was originally intended for Kinect environments, then to a lesser extent when stereo chat headsets were available.\n\nWhat the setting does is adjust the balance of TV and game/party chat that comes over the speakers when there is no headset connected to the controller/console. Have you ever noticed that when you unplug your headset the chat comes over the TV speakers along with the game? So what the setting does is it reduces the game volume by 50/80/100% while keeping the chat volume at the same level. All you're doing by setting it to \"Mute all other sounds\" is making the TV speakers output only game/party chat when you unplug the headset. It will mute the game but you will still hear other people.\n\nYou'll notice if you try it on the other settings and listen to the TV while having your headset plugged in while not wearing it, then when unplugging it from the controller you'll notice the volume of your game go down by half or 80% depending on the setting. If you choose \"Do nothing\" then the volume will stay the same.\n\nThe original intention of this setting was so that Kinect users wouldn't have the chat drowned out by the sound of the game so they could hear other players more clear.\n\n3 more replies\ntallwall250\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nLmao no that’s not what that setting does.\n\n2 more replies\nPidgeon_v3\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nThat's not what it does, just tested all options with my fan on in the background, noise comes through the mic exactly the same with all 4.\n\nzJeD4Y6TfRc7arXspy2j\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nIsn't that just for Kinect mics?\n\n1 more reply\nKingindan0rf\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nWhat?
