If you buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more about our review process.\n\nWe updated this article in February 2022 based on extensive testing done by the Good Housekeeping Institute Kitchen Appliances and Culinary Innovation Lab. We stand by our original top-rated picks, plus included two new products from OXO and FinalStraw.\n\nBy now, we all know that single-use plastics are dangerous for the environment, but even still, Americans use nearly 500 million plastic straws every day. Most single-use straws are too lightweight to be recognized by a mechanical recycling sorter, causing them to be disposed of as garbage which makes it more likely for them to end up in the ocean. At the rate we're using straws, there is estimated to be more plastic in the ocean than fish by 2050. As a result, many big brands and local coffee shops have banned plastic straws, meaning if you want a straw with your iced coffee, you’ll need to bring your own.\n\nFinding an easy-to-clean reusable straw can be tough, so the Kitchen Appliances and Culinary Innovation Lab put over 35 models to the test to find the best reusable straws. The Good Housekeeping Institute evaluates all types of sustainable products that help you make more eco-friendly choices. We test reusable straws with a broad panel of real testers who use the straws with coffee, water, and smoothies. Testers rate how easy each straw is to clean, carry on the go, as well as appearance and any strange aftertastes during or after use. After analyzing over 900 data points, we found the top-tested reusable straws on the market:\n\n\nOur top picks:\n\nOXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Straw Set (Set of 4)\n$21 AT AMAZON\nRead more\nYIHONG Reusable Stainless Steel Metal Straws (Set of 8)\n$12 AT AMAZON\nRead more\nGoSili Reusable Standard Straw (Set of 4)\n$14 AT AMAZON\nRead more\nKlean Kanteen Stainless Steel Straw Set (Set of 4)\n$10 AT AMAZON\nRead more\nSIPWELL Stainless Steel Drinking Straws (Set of 4)\n$6 AT AMAZON\nRead more\nSHOW MORE\n\nBest Overall Reusable Straws\n\nOXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Straw Set\nOXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Straw Set (Set of 4)\n$21 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: OXO\n\nKitchen Appliances and Culinary Innovation Lab Director Nicole Papantoniou loves the OXO straws, which are extendable and come with a sturdy and easy-to-use cleaning brush as well as a case to carry everything. \"The silicone part of the straw moves so you can adjust the length (genius!), and it's nice to sip out of silicone vs. metal,\" she says. We also love how these straws are dishwasher-safe and come in sets of four or six reusable straws.\n\nBest Value Reusable Straws\n\nYihong Reusable Stainless Steel Straws\nYIHONG Reusable Stainless Steel Metal Straws (Set of 8)\n$12 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: YIHONG\n\nThese stainless steel straws from Yihong cost about 50 cents a straw with two brushes and a pouch included. Testers liked that they had the option for a straight or bent straw depending on which drink or cup they were using, plus these straws have over 7,000 rave reviews on Amazon. Some of our testers noted that they didn’t like the feel of the metal against their teeth.\n\nBest Reusable Straws with Case\n\nGoSili Reusable Standard Straws\nGoSili Reusable Standard Straw (Set of 4)\n$14 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: GOSILI\n\nThis silicone reusable straw from GoSili received the highest overall score in our evaluations and is one of the most affordable picks. Our testers loved that the straws are comfortable to drink from and easy to take on the go. All of the testers were satisfied with the straw and especially loved the carrying case. These straws are dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning, so they do not come with a cleaning brush.\n\nBest Stainless Steel Reusable Straws\n\nKlean Kanteen Stainless Steel Straw Set\nKlean Kanteen Stainless Steel Straw Set (Set of 4)\n$10 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: KLEAN KANTEEN\n\nThese reusable straws by Klean Kanteen have a silicone tip with a stainless-steel bottom for easy sipping and cleaning — the silicone tip is removable, so testers found them easy to clean. Available in either four- or eight-packs, they come in a variety of bright colors with a cleaning brush included.\n\nMost Popular Reusable Straws on Amazon\nSipWell Stainless Steel Drinking Straws\nSIPWELL Stainless Steel Drinking Straws (Set of 4)\n$6 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: SIPWELL\n\nThese SipWell stainless steel drinking straws are widely popular on Amazon with over 13,000 reviews. These straws come in a set of four with options in different lengths. Testers overall liked using them but wished there was a bag included for easy carrying. Our testers also loved Sipwell’s reusable straws with silicone toppers, which are great for people who want the easy cleaning and durability of stainless steel with a more comfortable sipping experience of silicone.\n\nBest Portable Reusable Straws\nFinalStraw Collapsible Reusable Straws\nFinal Straw Collapsible Reusable Straw\n$20 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: FINALSTRAW\n\nWe absolutely love how FinalStraw comes with a cute, colorful and compact case so you can store your straw and cleaning brush inside. We also like how the stainless steel straw is offered in rainbow, silver, gold or black and comes with silicone tips on both ends of the straw to make sipping easier! One of our editors says \"Not only does this straw include a case, but it also can easily hook onto my purse so I never forget it at home.\" The same brand also makes a portable fork, FinalFork, that we also recommend.\n\nBest Silicone Reusable Straws\nSofty Straws Silicone Straws\nSofty Straws Silicone Straws (Set of 5)\nNow 13% Off\n$13 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: SOFTY STRAWS\n\nFor silicone straws, our testers liked these Softy Straws best. Our testers gave these straws high comfort scores, as they didn't have a funky aftertaste and were easy to sip from. These straws come in a pack of five with a squeegee cleaner included, which online reviewers found super easy to use. Because they are resistant to heat, our testers loved that they could use these straws with cold and hot beverages.\n\nBest Boba Reusable Straws\nAlink Glass Smoothie Straws\nALINK Glass Smoothie Straws (Set of 2)\nNow 25% Off\n$6 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: ALINK\n\nWhen drinking smoothies or boba tea, you need a wider straw that can accommodate a thicker beverage. The Alink glass smoothie straw is 14mm wide, which is nearly double the width of most reusable straws. They come in a set of two with a cleaning brush. Testers loved that they worked well with hot and cold beverages, but noted that the straws were too wide for some tumblers and water bottles.\n\nBest Plastic Reusable Straws\n\nJanyun Reusable Straws\nJanyun Plastic Reusable Straws (Set of 30)\n$11 AT AMAZON\nCREDIT: JANYUN\n\nMost reusable straws are solid colors, but these hard plastic straws by Janyum come in a 30 pack full of fun patterns, including polka dots, stripes, and fruits in bright colors – all testers loved the patterns. One downside: Our panel wished that these straws came with a carrying case, as they're difficult to bring on the go.\n\nHow to find the best reusable straw for you\n\nFirst, you should determine what type of beverage you want to use your reusable straw for. For example, if you plan to drink smoothies or other thicker beverages, you'll need a wider, firm straw. You should also check if the straw works for both cold and hot beverages if you plan to use it for both.\n\nReusable straws are available in a variety of materials, and each has pros and cons. Here's the scoop on different eco-friendly straw materials:\n\nSilicone: A bendy material that can be easily compressed for carrying. Keep in mind this flexibility can make inserting silicone straws into plastic cups or narrow bottles difficult.\nStainless steel: Metal reusable straws are firm and won’t lose their shape use after use. Some reviewers found a metal aftertaste with certain styles, especially when drinking water.\nGlass: These transparent reusable straws are easier to keep clean than other materials. On the downside, they are also more delicate and break more easily.\nHard plastic: One of the most affordable options for reusable straws, but they tend not to last as long as other materials.\nBamboo: A plant-based alternative to plastic, glass, steel and silicone, but they do deteriorate quicker than other materials.\n\nSome reusable straws are dishwasher-safe for easy cleaning. If not, after using your reusable straws, wash them in the sink with dish soap and warm water. If your straw doesn't come with a straw cleaner, we recommend investing in one for easy cleaning. Scrub the inside and outside of the straw before rinsing and using again.\n\nWhy trust Good Housekeeping?\n\nEmma Seymour is a Senior Textiles Product Analyst at the Good Housekeeping Institute.
