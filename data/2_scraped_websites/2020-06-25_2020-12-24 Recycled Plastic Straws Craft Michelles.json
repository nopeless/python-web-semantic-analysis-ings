How about melting them down to make some fun summer themed magnets?¬† Plastic straws are outlawed in these parts and I have tons collected over the years. I‚Äôm excited how you can recycle or upcycle your plastic straws to create almost any themed magnets, so let‚Äôs get started!\n\nDIY Magnets | Recycled Plastic Straws Craft\n\nIf you saw my HOW TO RE-PURPOSE PLASTIC STRAWS FOR PARTY DECOR ‚Äì CRICUT EASYPRESS CRAFT, you know I‚Äôm always trying to find ways I can re-purpose or reuse my large stash of plastic straws.¬† Creating ‚Äúsheets‚Äù of plastic in different color patterns using straws is a fun way to add to your crafting material stash.¬† The plastic is thin enough to cut with scissors and works great with die cutting machines like Sizzix.¬† I used my Sizzx big shot to cut these magnets but you can also just use a printed template of any shape, trace and cut with scissors. Which I did with the heart shaped ones. üôÇ\n\nWhat you will need:\n\nPlastic straws\n\n2 Heat protective sheets or Teflon sheets\n\nCricut EasyPress or Iron on high setting\n\nSizzix Big Shot or scissors\n\nSizzig Bigz Dies or printed template\n\nCraft sticks\n\nMagnets\n\nGlue\n\nStart by setting your EasyPress 2 on the highest setting of 400 degrees for 60 seconds.¬† If you are using an iron, set it on the highest setting without steam.\n\nLay out several plastic straws on a heat protective sheet and place another sheet on top.\n\nPlace your EasyPress or iron on top of the sheet for 1 minute.¬† Remove the sheet to reveal the melted straws!\n\nOnce cooled, either trace a shape on to the sheet and cut or use your Sizzix Big Shot and Bigz Dies to cut the shapes.\n\nFor the Sizzix, create a sandwich using a cutting pad, Bigz Die, plastic sheet and then another cutting pad on top.¬† Roll through the machine.\n\nPlace a craft stick on the die to cut mini Popsicle sticks. Yes, the Sizzix Big Shot can cut thin wood too! These mini Popsicle sticks are adorable!\n\nGlue the stick on the back of the Popsicle.\n\nGlue a magnet on the top of the stick.¬† You can also glue a clothespin and then a magnet to make a clip magnet. I did that with the large heart magnet.\n\nAren‚Äôt they cute! And it‚Äôs hard to believe these were once straws!\n\nI hope you give this project a try! If you are Instagram, be sure to tag me so I can see what you make. The possibilities are endless!\n\nHappy Crafting!\n\n¬†\n\nBe sure to check out these other fun recycled projects by my blogging friends!\n\n\nRelated Posts\n\nHow to Re-purpose Plastic Straws for Party Decor ‚Äì Cricut EasyPress Craft\n\nHow to Make Magnets With Cricut The Easy Way!\n\nHow to Make Holographic Magnets with Cricut\n\nHow to Make a Keychain with Sizzix Shrink Plastic\n\nHow to Make a Personalized Plastic Cup with Straw for a New Teacher Gift\n\nDIY Boo Gift Tags | Halloween Cricut Maker Craft\n\nDIY Spider Candy Bowl | Pumpkin Craft\n\nDIY Halloween Gnome | Dollar Tree Craft\n\nAUTHOR BIO\nARTICLE INFO\nPOPULAR POSTS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichelle Stewart\nOwner at Michelle's Party Plan-It\nHi there!
