The first known straws were made by the Sumerians and the oldest drinking straw in existence is a gold tube inlaid with the precious stone lapis lazuli that was found in a Sumerian tomb dated 3,000 B.C.\n\nWhile in most cases we can all get along without the need for a straw, they do have their advantages including reducing tooth decay when drinking soft drinks.\n\nThe problem with straws comes in with single-use plastic straws:\n\n– Plastic straws ranks as number 5 in The Ocean Conservancy’s top 10 most collected items at beach cleanups\n\n– Plastic straws harm marine life. Sea birds pick up and swallow small straws (like those from juice boxes) which block their airways and cause them to choke. Plastic is also increasingly being found in the digestive system of turtles and fish affecting the ocean food chain as well as humans\n\n– Plastic straws are easily swept up into gyres and get trapped, contributing to ocean garbage patches\n\nRefusing single-use plastic straws at home and at restaurants is easy to do and does have an impact. Fortunately we have straw options that are not plastic or harmful to our health; good old paper straws have improved greatly over the years and you can also find reusable glass straws and plant-based material straws.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiled Under: Environment\nTagged With: environment, ocean pollution, plastic pollution\n\nCATEGORIES\nEnvironment\nEssential Oils\nGiveaways\nGlass\nGlasstic\nHealthy Living\nRecipes\nThings We Like\nUncategorized\nWater\nYoga\nRECENT POSTS\nUnwrap the Magic: Finding the Perfect Gift this Holiday Season\n1 week ago\nThe holiday season is a time of joy, warmth, and a little bit of …Read More »\nEcological Footprint – Go Glass\n1 month ago\nWhat if we told you that replacing that disposable bottle that you use daily …Read More »\nThink Pink\n2 months ago\nDid you know that one in eight women in the United States will be …Read More »\n<strong>Don’t Let Dehydration Ruin Your Summer Travel Plans</strong>\n6 months ago\nJet lag doesn’t have to ruin your travel plans!
