Network latency is unchanged but there is more latency to the game and you can notice it. When playing on the built in app on Samsung TV the game feels local, it's really good but doesn't have HDR.",

Is it just me, I'm tired of it, there is no logic to it, sometimes it detects it completely randomly\n\nu/professional_burrito\n‚Ä¢\n6 hr. ago\nhmm?\nBug\nu/NVIDIAOFFICIAL\n‚Ä¢\nPromoted\nThe ultimate cloud gaming combo. üå©Ô∏è\n\nFor a limited time, get a 3-month GFN membership with purchase of a Chromebook Plus. ü§ù\n\ngoogle.com\nLearn More\nu/Desperate-Watch-8950\n‚Ä¢\n3 hr. ago\nDid anybody have a performance issue recently?\nGameplay\n\nI am coming back to play POE recently with GFN priority tier, just idk why the game is so lag and has fps drop. does anybody have the same issue.

I waited 3 days, but still no fix. I contacted support and it's been 2 days with no reply. like cmon, at least update your games on this service, it's been almost a week and I still cant play\n\nu/Other_Breakfast7505\n‚Ä¢\n4 hr. ago\nCyberpunk shows not supported at your location (US)\nDiscussion\n\nBeen playing Cyberpunk 2077 for a few weeks now problem, now it suddenly shows the game is not supported at your location. I am in the US, so that seemed very odd to me. After a few attempts it finally put me in a queue (400 gamers ahead of me with priority!). Seems like they now show this message instead of adding people in the queue. If those queues are not resolved will have to pause my membership. I only have like an hour to play in the evening, and they expect me to spend 40 minutes in the queue?\n\nu/IAmEkza\n‚Ä¢\n17 hr. ago\nThe Day Before should be removed from the banner of GFN.\nDiscussion\n\nAs a Scam of a game that was developed by lying exploitative poeple, that doesn't meet the minimum it is advertising as.

When I bring up the GFN stats it will say something along the lines of (US/Central-CHI-03) or it will be the MIS Southeast server or a few others I've noticed. In other words.... It SAYS 'US Central' which is the server I chose manually and is chosen for me automatically as well, but then GFN seems to be giving me servers from other regions regardless.... Which def leads to the difference between 15/20ms ping and 30-40ms ping which is a huge difference depending on the game and thus massively frustrating to have to keep restarting until I get the correct one served.\n\nIs anyone else having this issue... Any ideas? I'm on a Mac is that's relevant. Or is this due to server congestion?\n\nView full post\nu/AirNationalGuard\n‚Ä¢\nPromoted\nGuardsmen in the Air National Guard are able to serve wherever they call home and in a role that best suits their skills.\n\nServe Close To Home\n\nairforce.com\nLearn More\nu/Zoe_Ervade\n‚Ä¢\n15 hr. ago\nEyes getting tired only by playing GFN‚Ä¶am I old?\nQuestions / Tech Support\n\nWhenever I have it on a Tablet or my TV screen, I do feel my eyes getting tired and blurry after playing for a couple of hours.

Would upgrading membership solve this issue or every rig comes with 16GB limitation? I'am currently on Priority.\n\nu/Mindless-Addendum621\n‚Ä¢\n11 hr. ago\nUS Midwest not working since last night\nQuestions / Tech Support\n\nBoth on Shield and my Android phone, I get an error when trying to launch games.

Never had this issue in the years I used the service.
