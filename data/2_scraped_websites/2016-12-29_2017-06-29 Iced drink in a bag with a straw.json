  "body": "plastic bags are pretty great. Plastic in general really. I think that's something that people don't realize is a very new thing. People look at computers and the internet and remark \"wow look at the progress\". Plastics basically came into their own after WW2, kinda exactly like computers, and they are in EVERYTHING now.",

In a lot of ways it's actually quite clever, though if I got a bagged drink in a bar or restaurant and I paid good money for it I'd be annoyed.\n\nReply\nreply\n75 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThis is done in Mexico. Normally not in restaurants but when you buy a bottle of soda at the store. They will ask if you are drinking it in the store. If you say no they will pour it in krona sandwich bag and put a straw in it. They keep the bottle to recycle it and you look like a fool drinking out of your bag.\n\nReply\nreply\n11 more replies\nBlukoi\n•\n7 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 7 yr. ago\n\nWell I, for one, don't see how a plate would help with this. But then again, I'm kinda drunk at the moment.\n\nMaybe I'll understand when I sober up.\n\nEdit: I'm up now, sober, and still don't understand how a plate would help with this.\n\nReply\nreply\n6 more replies\nPM_ME_YOUR_SMlLE\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nit's a redneck Capri Sun\n\nReply\nreply\nmylifeisaparty\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nI live in El Salvador and this is the most normal thing.

Although the bag usually has a string tag that you can use to carry your drink\n\nReply\nreply\ndamnitsteeve\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThis happens in South America as well. I believe it's because there is a deposit on the bottles so they don't give those away.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nprincessjld\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThat's not very environmentally friendly\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nroybz99\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nAnd you want a plate for that?\n\nReply\nreply\nblackrumonrocks\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThis sub is slowly becoming r/wewantpropereatingdevices\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\ninksaywhat\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThis is normal across the globe.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\npandaflips\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nDoes anyone else think that leaf looks like a uterus?
