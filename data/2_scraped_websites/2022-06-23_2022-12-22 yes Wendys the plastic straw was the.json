Now its the reverse as if that's any better for the environment.\n\nkwixtylz1\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nI've actually been reusing a Wendy's plastic cup for a week now. Never done that with any plastic straw. Its a plus in my books\n\nperrinoia\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nPaper cups and straws are coated in wax to make them temporarily water proof and permanently unrecyclable aka single use and disposable.\n\nPlastic cups and straws can be recycled and reused almost indefinitely, but most people use them as single use products because the plastic is too thin to wash without melting in most dishwashers.\n\nPlastic is a superior product, but recycling infrastructure is either non-existent or fake in most places around the world, and even if they were as common as churches and strip clubs in the bible belt, the masses would still toss them in the nearest trash can rather than seeking out a recycle bin.\n\n1 more reply\nthecr0tch\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nWhy does it say MOM on her neck?\n\nmoondogg81\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nI noticed that years ago and could never un-see it\n\nfirebolt1171\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nOh god, I can't unsee it\n\n1 more reply\n5 more replies\nImportant-Aside-507\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\ntook me a second to realize it was a paper straw with a fully plastic cup.

The new cups will use 20% certified recycled plastic and will launch in the United States and Canada. Wendyâ€™s says the move is part of a plan to keep 10 million pounds of waste out of landfills over the next two years.\n\n2 more replies\nKitchen_Device7682\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nIsn't the problem that plastic straws can get stuck in sea animal noses? I think nobody argues that paper straws will solve the plastic problem. What you should check is if plastic can be recycled\n\nJackMeHoff266\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nIâ€™m not tryna single you out bcuz Iâ€™ve seen others post similar things like this, but I donâ€™t understand the sentiment behind this. Yes I get the stupidity behind using paper straw with plastic cups, but is it not a good thing to reduce plastic usage even in the slightest way? Seems like reducing plastic use in any way is the new trend (in my state, businesses are not allowed to provide plastic bags and straws) and obviously it wonâ€™t all happen overnight but atleast we can start small and work our way up. Pretty soon, plastic cups will also be banned as well.\n\nAlso thereâ€™s a reason why plastic straw are specifically targeted- itâ€™s bcuz of their design that causes them to get stuck in sea turtle nostrils and in whales.\n\nAgain not tryna single you out but it irks me to see ppl complain about paper straws all the time. Seems like such a first world problem- if we arenâ€™t willing to make little changes like that, how do we expect to make big changes in the future? Like when weâ€™ll have to limit our energy and water usage, which is already happening in many parts of the world\n\n2 more replies\n[deleted]\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nStraws are too skinny and small to get filtered out as recyclables when they filter the recycling so they slip through and end up in landfills. The cups and lids are large enough to get filtered out. So there actually is a reason.\n\nAltruistic-Status-98\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nThe mom thing was supposed to be subliminal but its so fricken apparent\n\nAny_Afternoon_5589\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nA mom necklace on a young girl.. old fashion square burgers..just wholesome advertising from yesteryear.\n\nCC_bbx\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nI cannot issue the perceive here.\n\nBen_r_dover\nâ€¢\n1 yr. ago\n\nWow another one of the 159871651928354 posts like this.
