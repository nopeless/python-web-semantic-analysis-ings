New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.\nSort by:\nhickory-smoked\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nTypically, single-use plastic cups are recyclable, and plastic straws are not. So the barista is not actually as hypocritical as the comic suggests.\n\nEither way, if you want to do better, bring your own cup/straw.\n\n8 more replies\n[deleted]\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nPaper straws feel horrible and melt so easily. Why not just build straws into the cups and make the cups recyclable\n\n1 more reply\nteddy_vedder\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nAsk a lot of Starbucks employees and you‚Äôll find out many locations just toss their recyclable trash in with their regular trash at the end of the day üôÉ\n\nSmegmaOnDemand\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nI mean you need to start small if you want to make big changes. It would be too abrasive for most people to adapt to if you tried to make drastic modifications all at once.\n\n8 more replies\nasd193\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nDrink without a straw? Like a soda?\n\n9 more replies\nmattygeenz\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nI really dont see a joke here?\n\nwot0\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nI didn't get the joke at first, then I realized the cup.\n\nGood_old_Marshmallow\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nGeneral plastic cups can be of a high enough quality to be recycled or biodegradable.

Baby steps.\n\n[deleted]\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nThrow it in the baristas face it‚Äôs all her fault. Companies don‚Äôt make changes like that. Then sue for emotional trauma cause by the paper straw.\n\n4 more replies\nMillionDollarBooty\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nIf you hate paper straws so much, just buy a metal one to use. It's environmentally friendly and doesn't disintegrate. Hell, if you have time just bring your own cup and you get a discount too. No waste that way.\n\nquimblesoup\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nI have one and love it but I literally never remember it.\n\nGrymare\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nIn my local Starbucks they didn't even know about the discount and veery reluctantly used the cup i brought.\n\nThey really should advertise a lot more for it if they want to have a greener public image.\n\n1 more reply\n2 more replies\nIGotNoCleverNames\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nWhat's even worse is spoons. I went to a Ben and Jerry's shop the other day (ice cream) and they served with wooden spoons. My lips still hurt 4 days late as a result.\n\nBearmancartoons\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nDon‚Äôt chew them\n\n[deleted]\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nI assume your talking about Starbucks and I'd like to add that Starbucks is owned by nestle\n\nRejectUF\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nNestle owns the rights to distribute Starbucks products outside the actual Starbucks stores, but does not own Starbucks itself.\n\n1 more reply\nGetNifty\n‚Ä¢\n4 yr. ago\n\nWhy did you turn the costumer black?
