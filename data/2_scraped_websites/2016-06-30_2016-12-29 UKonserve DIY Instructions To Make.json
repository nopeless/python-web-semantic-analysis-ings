In celebration, we want to share our favorite recipe for making straw sleeves to carry your reusable straws on the go. Don’t own a reusable straw yet? Here’s why you should think twice before using plastic:\n\nAmericans use 500 million plastic straws every day.\nPlaced end to end, the number of disposable straws used in the U.S. in the past four days could reach the moon.\nWe use enough to fill over 125 school buses with plastic straws every day. That’s 46,000 school buses every year full of straws.\n\nFor this project, we recommend reusing old fabric you already have or purchasing from a second-hand shop. Old tablecloths, cloth napkins and heavy t-shirts work! If you are purchasing fabric, we suggest organic cotton or unbleached muslin.\n\nDIY Reusable Straw Sleeves\n\nSupplies (makes one sleeve):\n1/2 yard fabric\nMeasuring tape or small ruler\nScissors\nStraight pins\nFabric marker\nSewing machine\n\nDirections:\n\nCut fabric into a rectangle that is 14.5″ x 2″. Take fabric and fold it in half to make a shape that is now 14.5″ x 1″. If you’d like, run a warm iron over the fabric to smooth it out.\nCut a 1/2″ strip of extra fabric for ties. Use a pen to mark the 1/2″ pieces and cut along the width of the fabric. \nIf you’d like a finished edge along the opening of the sleeve, fold the top of the rectangle over 1/4″ and zigzag stitch along the edge.\nMeasure up 8″ from the bottom of the sleeve and pin the tie in the seam.\nPlace your reusable straw or a knife inside of the fabric for stability when sewing. Place straight pins along the bottom and open side of the fabric.\nZig zag stitch along the bottom and open edge of the sleeve until you’ve made it to the top.\nPlace straw and straw brush inside, fold over excess fabric on the top and wrap the tie around the sleeve to keep your reusable straw in place.\n\nYou can easily make this project kid friendly by using felt for the sleeve and whipstitching the bottom and side edges.
