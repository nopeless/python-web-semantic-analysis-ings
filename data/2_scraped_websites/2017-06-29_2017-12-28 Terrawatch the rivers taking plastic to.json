If we continue at this rate, some estimate that our oceans will contain more plastic than fish by 2050. So where does all the plastic come from? New research reveals that just 10 river systems transport more than 90% of the global input of plastic into to the world’s oceans.\n\nRivers are the arteries of our planet. From tiny tumbling streams to vast sluggish deltas, rivers are the link between the atmosphere, land and oceans. Since time immemorial people have clustered near rivers, taking advantage of the fresh water, fertile land, ready-made transport links and plentiful fish. And of course rivers are also excellent conveyor belts for whisking rubbish away.\n\nRegister: it’s quick and easy\n\nIt’s still free to read – this is not a paywall\n\nWe’re committed to keeping our quality reporting open.

The research cited names the 10 rivers that carry most of the plastic pollution carried by River systems into the oceans, however the article erroneously implies that these rivers are responsible for carrying 90% of ALL plastic pollution to the ocean.\n\nReport\nLoclnor\n7 Nov 2017 11.35\n1\n\nNow is the time for everybody to work together to stop this from happening. It is obvious that these countries need help. They have no refuse systems and that is the main problem. All countries should get together to help finance and build plants to help these countries deal with their waste.\n\nReport\nslartibartfast90\n      Loclnor\n7 Nov 2017 13.07\n1\n\nWhile what you say is true, most of the oceanic pollution comes from plastic from industrialised nations. Developed nations may not have garbage lying on the streets however the consumerist lifestyle and poor social attitudes towards recycling and frugality mean that waste management in rich countries is equally bad if not worse. Worse actually since the per capita carbon footprint as well as use of plastics is much higher....\n\nReport\nView more comments\nMost viewed\nMost Viewed\nAcross The Guardian\nMost Viewed\nIn Science\nMost viewed Across the&nbsp;Guardian\n‘It’s hell being famous’: second violent death of Serial podcast character raises ethics questions\nShe’s a megastar, but Taylor Swift just won’t shake off old feuds.
