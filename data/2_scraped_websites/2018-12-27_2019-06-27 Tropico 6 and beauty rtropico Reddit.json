I'm trying to increase the beauty of my island. But are any other ways than building parks? Most of my cities are totally red in beauty scale and I couldn't find any tips to how to get it to green, if it's even possible in areas where I have apartments. Should I just build more sparsely and add more parks? Does housing budget have any effect?\n\nhomedepot.com\nLearn More\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nthe_io\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nSea Disposal is very good for lowering pollution, but that's Modern Era and pisses off the superpowers.\n\nReply\nreply\nbluesatin\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nPollution was an issue in previous games, I assume it'll factor in on number 6.\n\nThere was things to do with making sure you had enough garbage disposal, enacting edicts to do with reducing pollution etc.\n\nNot destroying natural tree areas also seemed to help the overall beauty level of the island from what I remember, as it was considered natural beauty. But of course that doesn't help for built up areas and localised beauty levels.\n\nReply\nreply\nGarage_Knight_YT\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nI noticed that oil rigs lower the beauty a lot. So I guess pollution does have a huge impact. I destroyed the oil rigs and pollution got lower but the beauty factor didn't rise. Does it even replenish over time?\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\njlkingIII\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nAlso try and reduce shacks. Shacks will cause beauty to drop significantly.\n\nReply\nreply\nGarage_Knight_YT\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nIt would be nice if you could send police to automatically destroy shacks. I got plenty of jobs and free houses and people still live in shacks and are unemployed. Sent few of them to asylum since they're obviously insane lol\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nnightreg\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThe statues of el presidente which you can find under Media buildings increase beauty very much and they only need 1 tile of space, other then the normal parks which require a lot of space the have the same effect, but they are quite expensive with 5 k base cost\n\nReply\nreply\nGarage_Knight_YT\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nThanks I haven't used much of those\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 3%\nRank by size \nRelated\nTropico\nCity-building game\nGaming\nforward\nback\nr/MisterBald\nI Crossed The World's Deadliest Jungle: Darien Gap\nyoutube\n364 upvotes · 153 comments\nr/Cynicalbrit\nThis makes me happy\nyoutube\n183 upvotes · 19 comments\nr/Cynicalbrit\nGeekenders - Jesse and Dodger RETURN!\nyoutube\n110 upvotes · 7 comments\nr/hellblade\nNew Senua's Saga: Hellblade II Trailer\nyoutube\n300 upvotes · 50 comments\nr/CRPG\nWH40k: Rogue Trader Review - Mortismal Gaming\nyoutube\n225 upvotes · 74 comments\nr/BSG\nToday is the Sixteenth Anniversary of the airing of \"Razor,\" and the Most Shocking Revelation in Battlestar Galactica\nyoutube\n154 upvotes · 53 comments\nr/aoe2\nComparing HD pathing to current DE pathing\nyoutube\n152 upvotes · 45 comments\nr/aoe2\nMemb THOUGHTS ABOUT WARLORDS and CONCERNS - LAST MEMBTV EVENT???\nyoutube\n123 upvotes · 160 comments\nr/commandandconquer\nMental Omega - Act III Announcement // Red Alert 2\nyoutube\n112 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/victoria3\n1.5: Discussing the Good, The Bad And The Ugly | One Proud Bavarian video\nyoutube\n200 upvotes · 35 comments\nr/NeilBreen\nNeil Breen Updated Us!\nyoutube\n144 upvotes · 33 comments\nr/TheHague\nThe destruction of the Hague during WW-II in color\nyoutube\n111 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/aoe2\nReal-Time Strategy is incredible and you should play it\nyoutube\n188 upvotes · 79 comments\nr/aoe2\nEarly Pathing was Better in AoE2:DE\nyoutube\n104 upvotes · 58 comments\nr/preformances\nEmily (Emma) Stone's first credit in VH1's The New Partridge Family (2004)\nyoutube\n122 upvotes · 25 comments\nr/macgaming\nStray on Mac!
