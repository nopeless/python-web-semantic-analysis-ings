Reusable straws are a fantastic eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastic straws.\n\nBy choosing bamboo, silicone, or metal straws (ideally recycled metal), you’ll reduce the amount of plastic waste in landfills or our oceans, which increases by 1.4 million kilograms daily.\n\nAre Paper Straws Environmentally Friendly?\n\nWhile paper straws are considered more environmentally friendly than plastic straws, their eco-friendliness is nuanced.\n\nTheir manufacturing process can require significant water, energy, and chemicals for bleaching and strengthening the paper. Transportation emissions and deforestation from sourcing raw materials can also increase their carbon footprint.\n\nThough we love that they’re compostable straws, paper straws aren’t as durable as other plastic-straw alternatives—they go soggy and start to break down if left in liquids. This means more are needed, negating some of their environmental benefits.\n\nStill, for disposable options, the best biodegradable straws are those made of paper, bamboo, or wood, but you may also find some biodegradable plastic straws made of PLA (Polylactic Acid), formed of plant starches like corn or sugarcane straws.\n\nThey’re not strictly zero waste, but they are dissolvable and can break down quickly.\n\nOther Considerations For The Best Non-Plastic Straws\n\nWe obviously appreciate when brands provide sustainable alternatives—like an alternative to plastic drinking straws—but we also look to see if they’re trying to be more eco-friendly, too.\n\nCarbon reduction plans, offsets, use of renewable energy, mindful packaging, and energy-conserving manufacturing are all things that give the best sustainable straws an extra special sip in our book.\n\nWe also look for brand supply chain transparency and charitable actions.\n\nClosing Thoughts On Environmentally Friendly Straws\n\nWhether you’re a smoothie aficionado, a cocktail connoisseur, or simply want to savor your favorite beverage, let your gulps be guided by eco-consciousness with our pick of the best plastic straw alternatives.\n\nBut don’t forget about used options! If you’re looking to procure sustainable steel straws cheap, a local thrift store is your best bet.\n\nThe next step is to keep your eco-friendly straws on hand in your purse or briefcase, so you never have to ask, “What straws are eco-friendly in bars?” and be disappointed if your bartender doesn’t have a reusable one on hand.\n\nBut use it as an opportunity to ask them why. By consciously choosing eco-friendly straws, bars and restaurants can play their part in creating a greener food and drink scene—and you can help action a change.\n\nEven if you can’t change a whole establishment, you can probably change at least one person—so share this article with a friend and toast to reducing plastic waste together.\n\nSubscribe to the pebble mag Newsletter\n\nGet weekly insights, guides and news to support our collective transition to a better, more sustainable future.\n\nSUBSCRIBE\nMore from pebblemag...\nHOME & LIVING\n9 Favorited Sustainable Christmas Decorations You Can Deck The Hall With\n\nBy Amber McDaniel\n\nZERO WASTE\n7 Zero Waste Gift Wrapping Ideas For A Less Disposable Christmas\n\nBy Francesca Brooking\n\nHOME & LIVING\nHow To Make Origami Stars To Decorate Your Home\n\nBy Steph Simpson\n\nHOME & LIVING\nHow To Make A Sustainable Christmas Wreath So You Can DIY All On Your Own\n\nBy Steph Simpson\n\nHOME & LIVING\nSustainable Christmas Trees: A Guide To The Real, Fake, & Eco-Friendly\n\nBy Steph Simpson\n\nHOME & LIVING\n27 Sustainable Christmas Ideas To Make Your Festive Season An Eco-Friendly One\n\nBy Steph Simpson\n\nHOME & LIVING\nEasy DIY Paper Baubles You Can Make This Christmas Season\n\nBy Jo Hill\n\nHOME & LIVING\n11 Easy DIY Christmas Decorations You Can Make Right At Home\n\nBy Steph Simpson\n\nSUBSCRIBE\n\npebble magazine is a member of the Sustainable Jungle Network and a member of One Percent For The Planet.
