Mostly European cars?\n\nIf so, i can explain.\n\nThe sticky plastic pieces are actually coated with a \"soft touch\" coating. You can Google that exact phrase and it'll come right up. Basically, you take a regular plastic piece (typically ABS plastic in automotive interiors) that feels, well.... like plastic, and spray this coating over it. Once it dries it feels awesome to the touch. Soft, slick but dry. Honestly it feels great when it's new.\n\nThe problem is it degrades over time and turns into a sticky, nasty mess. The heat and constant temperature changes in a car's interior, plus all the grabbing and touching with dirty, oily hands really speeds up the process. This is why the driver's door handle on a BMW tends to be the fastest part that turns to nasty goo.\n\nIf you've never seen or touched a sticky car interior, i highly recommend you do. It'll blow your mind that companies are still using that coating after what happens to it\n\n15 more replies\nkoalaposse\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nI don’t know specifically. But some plastics the chains are more rigidly fixed than others. And some plastics are more porous than others, (plastic bottles designed to contain oils must be a different kind to those for water), while other hard plastics will become more brittle with age.\n\nIt is often that the structure or atomic chains of some plastics will de-coalesce and both shed and bond more readily with oils in the environments, and exude those they are made from, as they deteriorate, certain plastics will be effected over time like this. When they are heated, it also weakens these bonds for certain plastics.\n\nWhifflepoof\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nIn plastics, there are basically two types: hard rigid plastic that holds its shape well and soft rubbery plastic that conforms to other shapes and is more comfortable to the touch. The two plastics are mixed together to achieve the right consistency for whatever the job is (tv body, bleach bottle, kite) but they don't necessarily mix well and chemicals are used to keep them from separating. Sometimes the chemicals separate or breakdown a long time after they're mixed, and you get sticky plastics or residue that is literally the chemicals leaching out of the solution.\n\nSource: I had a TV hanging on my wall for years, and when I went to move it there was a gritty, oily residue on certain parts of the plastic but not all. After years of being in support and installing, fixing, and replacing many types of modern devices, I had never run into this before. It was very obvious that it was only one particular type of plastic. I did a bunch of research to figure out if I needed to be concerned about the chems all over my hands as well as the possibility of my family breathing this in for years. After a surprisingly long and fruitless period of research, I found references to chemicals that are used to soften hard plastics leaching out of devices and causing this type of issue. After I acquainted myself with the basics of how plastics are made, it made sense.\n\nfekinEEEjit\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nI have a commercial heating oil truck, a 2001 International 4900, and the steering wheel and part of the dash dose this and it drives me crazy. I have cleaned it with all sorts of chemicals and its always sticky again in a day or 2. Lucky its not a daily driver just a back up but as its a little tough to drive I'm the only one to use it when we get real busy.\n\nTER47cap\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nGive it a good rubbing with baking soda and a bit of water. Mix the baking soda with the water to obtain a density similar to toothpaste. It will eliminate the sticky. UV light to return yellowed plastic to white.

These mixed in chemicals escape over time.\n\n \n24\nRank by size \nr/todayilearned\nTIL: The Prionailurus rubiginosus or \"Rusty Spotted Cat\" is the world's smallest cat.
