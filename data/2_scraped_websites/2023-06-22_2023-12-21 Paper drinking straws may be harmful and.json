I watched oppenheimer a few weeks ago and i went through 3 straws\n\nReply\nreply\nLorkhi\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nThe cinema I go to just uses very robust plastic cups and straws which are reusable. Unlike paper straws or the old cups these actually feel like an upgrade. They're just not feasible for takeaways.\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\n42 more replies\nPhysicaque\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nTL;DR It should not endanger your health but use steel straws if you want to be sure.\n\nHere are the main bits from the article:\n\nBelgian researchers tested 39 brands of straws for the group of synthetic chemicals known as poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\n\n...They break down very slowly over time and can persist over thousands of years in the environment, a property that has led to them being known as \"forever chemicals.\"\n\nPFAS were found in the majority of the straws tested and were most common in those made from paper and bamboo.\n\nThe paper straws were most likely to contain PFAS, with the chemicals detected in 18/20 (90%) of the brands tested. PFAS were also detected in 4/5 (80%) brands of bamboo straw, 3/4 (75%) of the plastic straw brands and 2/5 (40%) brands of glass straw. They were not detected in any of the five types of steel straw tested.\n\nThe most commonly found PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been banned globally since 2020.\n\nAlso detected were trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and trifluoromethanesulfonic acid (TFMS), \"ultra-short chain\" PFAS which are highly water soluble and so might leach out of straws into drinks.\n\nThe PFAS concentrations were low, and bearing in mind that most people tend to only use straws occasionally, pose a limited risk to human health. However, PFAS can remain in the body for many years and concentrations can build up over time.\n\nDr. Groffen concludes, \"The presence of PFAS in paper and bamboo straws shows they are not necessarily biodegradable. We did not detect any PFAS in stainless steel straws, so I would advise consumers to use this type of straw—or just avoid using straws at all.\"\n\nReply\nreply\n26 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n4 mo. ago\namongusimpostorsex\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nSo glad that i have to drink of a paper napkin for nothing to change\n\nReply\nreply\nElamia\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nWhat about bamboo straw ?\n\nBamboo grow so fast, it can basically become a nuisance if left unchecked, so we will not run out and can be cheap enough.\n\nReply\nreply\nbeeg0d\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nFrom the article\n\nPFAS were found in the majority of the straws tested and were most common in those made from paper and bamboo\n\nReply\nreply\nZelvik_451\n•\n4 mo. ago\n•\nEdited 4 mo. ago\n\nDepends on whether the bamboo in Europe is useable for it. If not you need to transport it halfway around the planet to use it as one time straws. Best are metal and plastic straws that are resuseable.\n\nReply\nreply\n20 more replies\n18 more replies\nThick-Nose5961\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nGlad we banned those evil plastic straws and replaced them with more expensive straws that poison the user and the environment.
