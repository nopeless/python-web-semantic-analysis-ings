I sell lots of things on eBay and while it saves on packing to have 50 different box sizes, it really is a burden to keep all boxes stocked. So what I do is I buy boxes that will fit severally different items, even if that means I have to use more packing material because it’s easier and cheaper than having so many different sizes on hand.\n\n6 more replies\nJ_T_L_\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\n\"Adapteri\" Is that finnish I see?

The planet isnt going to die from how many straws we use, the much bigger impact are the externalized costs corporations pass off without the consumers knowledge.\n\nLike me driving less won't mean shit while barges are spewing crude between here and China. It's like, sure I can do my part but it won't mean shit without holding the real polluters accountable, and all the energy spent screaming at me is effort not being directed at them.\n\nAnyone else feel the same way about these green programs? Maybe they can explain it better than I have. I care about the environment and try to do my part but I feel like they are putting lipstick on a pig.\n\n1 more reply\nCoolmonster399\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nHere is a hot take, maybe this is not the problem either, it's the way we dispose of said plastic is the damn problem.\n\n32 more replies\nKiaxia\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nPlastic in whole is the problem and straws are included\n\n55 more replies\nPanchosLegend\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nNot the *only problem\n\n[deleted]\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nPlastic straws are not the only* problem.\n\nNewnustart\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nStraws are still a problem\n\n[deleted]\n•\n5 yr. ago\n\nYeah, plastic straws are made of thinner material which breaks down more easily into microplastics.
