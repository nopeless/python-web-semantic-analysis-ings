More pollution!\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nSteveHarveyLaserBeam\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nImagine needing a straw for your sippy cup lmao\n\nReply\nreply\nFlanTamarind\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI've started just taking the lid off of my drinks instead of getting a straw. It's really an unnecessary convenience.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nCakeDayOrDeath\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nIn all seriousness, for people with certain physical disabilities who need straws to drink liquids safely, a sippy cup style lid is not a replacement for a straw- a straw doesn't require you to pick up a cup of liquid and to tip your head back to drink it.\n\nI hate Dave Rubin, but the disability community has some very legitimate concerns about straw bans.\n\nJessica Kellgren-Fozard made a video on this topic.\n\nReply\nreply\n13 more replies\nSkippy_the_Alien\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI've been alive for 33 years. I can honestly say I've never seen anything more pathetic than virtue signaling with plastic straws\n\nReply\nreply\nKecemotRybecx\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nSeriously.\n\nThe only people I hear bitching about it are stupid cunts like Dave Rubin.\n\nNo one cares and most people are find seeing them go becise they have more important shit to do with their lives.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nberry-bostwick\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nPaper straws in California!\n\n🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸\n\nDid I own the conservatives?\n\nReply\nreply\ncobainstaley\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\npolluting to own the libs. the right are children.\n\nReply\nreply\ntheinfamousroo\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nAh South Dakota home to mount rushmore and nothing else.\n\nAnd this is coming from a former SD Resident\n\nReply\nreply\nSkippy_the_Alien\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nCongratulations on fleeing your state before that crazy eyed governor of yours exposed it to covid to \"own the libs\"\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\n2 more replies\nrube_X_cube\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI live in Los Angeles and it’s all plastic straws as far as the eye can see out here. And even if it was all paper straws, this would still be the dumbest, pettiest bullshit to whine about.\n\nReply\nreply\n17 more replies\nFormerIceCreamEater\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nStuff like this is really why conservatives are so extremely lame. It is all about the culture war for them and to them, the culture extends to every aspect of American life.\n\nIt is funny when people like Ben Shapiro or Dave Rubin say things like \"everything is politicized\" now days. Yes because you idiots are politicizing it!\n\nReply\nreply\nPatSteh92\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nDave is about as culture warrior as it gets. If Democrats boycotted short skirts, he would be wearing one in a video the next day to own the libs.\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nbreezer_z\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nWhat a twat\n\nReply\nreply\ndarknessdown\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nImagine living somewhere you hate only so you can romanticize South Dakota. Dave can be a conservative in California or a liberal in Texas and he’d be the same person\n\nReply\nreply\nKidflame171993\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nHow does anyone take this person seriously?\n\nReply\nreply\nKecemotRybecx\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nDave Rubin is a stupid cunt.\n\nReply\nreply\nSportsfan97__\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nIt’s so frustrating they turn actual real life issues into their bullshit culture wars\n\nReply\nreply\nJonpaddy\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nWhat passes for a “victory” for these people is beyond pathetic.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nIs triggering the libs the only thing he cares about?
