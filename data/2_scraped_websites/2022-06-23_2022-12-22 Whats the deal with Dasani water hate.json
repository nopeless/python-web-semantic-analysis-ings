In my childhood, it was what I considered \"premium\".\n\nRecently, however, I have had the opportunity to sample many different brands of bottled water, both cheap and upscale. In general, I found the Dasani and Pure Life brands superior in taste to more upscale (and expensive) brands like Fiji and Evian.\n\nAside from going against the general maxim that more expensive is better, it goes against what seems like passionate hatred of Dasani.\n\nMy trials involved using a given brand of water as my drinking water for however long my supply would last, but at least a week. I bought enough Fiji bottles to last at least a week. I still have Evian bottles in reserve, in case I run out of my preferred brand. Suffice to say, Evian is not preferable in my mouth to other brands. I've tried many other store-brand and eclectic brands of water as well.\n\nI've narrowed down my favorite brands to Dasani and Pure Life. I don't know about Pure Life, but Dasani has a horrible reputation among most people. It's my favorite brand. I only buy Pure Life because I get more water per dollar buying gallons than buying 36 packs of Dasani bottles. A typical trip to the store has me buying 6 gallons of Pure Life and 2 36 packs of Dasani.\n\nSo I don't get the hate. Fiji and Evian are two of the most expensive, widely-available brands on the market, and they are both inferior to Dasani in my view. But people hate Dasani. I'd love to buy what they're drinking, assuming it's not a simple case of subjectivity.\n\nI acknowledge that for every 99 people that hate Dasani, 1 person loves it, and I could very well be that person. I just find it hard to believe that my own personal tastes differ from the consensus in such a radical way. It's easier to believe that the hate for Dasani is overrepresented, and more people like it than is readily apparent.\n\nContext(?): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ieRUprt89m61ueR3nLoWER0Btt3G0011/view?usp=sharing\n\nRead more\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nejpierle\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nAnswer: The issue with those brands, specifically, is that they are bottled by Coca Cola (Dasani) and Nestle (Pure Life) off local, municipal water supplies. The hate comes from giant, evil mega corps getting rich selling you city water (they paid a penny for) for a dollar, all while contributing to the dangerous amounts of pollution that comes from single use plastics like water bottles. Coke and Nestle aren't the only ones guilty of this, of course, but ppl already think they are evil, so they get the most hate for doing it. But on a related note - please stop buying plastic water bottles. It's just city water anyway, run through a filter. Buy a Brita and filter your own city water, then put it in a reusable bottle. It'll cost a few bucks up front but it's way cheaper in the long run.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nReverse osmosis systems are great.

The context you provide is dubious since it's restricted access.\n\nHowever, Pure Life belongs to Nestlé and r/FuckNestle .\n\nAlso, a quick web search on Dasani gave out this:\n\nhttps://waterzen.com/blog-posts/real-story-behind-dasani-water-scandals/\n\nhttps://www.imm3rsive.com/controversy/dasani-water-controversy/17670/\n\nReply\nreply\nDanielnrg\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI had no idea it's restricted access, but I also didn't really understand what context in this context meant. I just put up a picture of a Dasani water bottle on my Google Drive.\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\n1 more reply\nbarfplanet\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nAnswer: Water needs mineral content to taste good. Most waters have unique minerals from where they're bottled, including the ones that are just municipal water put in bottles. Everyone has slightly different tastes, and people will settle on different brands they like best. Usually whatever people like best tastes most \"pure\" to them, even though it's technically impurities that they're tasting.\n\nDasani takes the step of just adding minerals themselves instead of using water that people will like from the start. This let's them get a more consistent product by filtering the heck out 9f water from all over the place, and adding their special blend of minerals on top. The result is a really polarizing flavor that some people find really gross. Personally I like it but some people really dislike it.\n\nThe other poster that mentioned the political bits about Coca Cola being a bad company is also right, but I'm pretty sure there are more people who don't care about all that and just think it tastes gross.\n\nReply\nreply\nDatKaz\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nYeah, that stuff is mostly just an online person’s point of contention. Most people regularly drinking bottled water aren’t making preferences out of some cognizance of environmental impact, or else they wouldn’t be drinking bottled water lol\n\nReply\nreply\nstickler64\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nAnswer: A number of people hate anyone that pollutes our planet with plastic bottles that don't ever get recycled.
