At least people seem to feel bad about throwing a plastic straw on the ground.\n\n7 more replies\nGeneralIncompetence\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThe paper ones can't be recycled everywhere. Some councils can process them, others can't. It's worth checking yours.\n\n2 more replies\nKevinGredditt\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nAnyone that uses a straw sucks.\n\n20 more replies\nboyfrndDick\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nIt’s been a year since they banned plastic straws here in Vancouver. I absolutely loathe the paper alternatives\n\n16 more replies\nwadenelsonredditor\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nInstead of doing something substantial they ban plastic straws.\n\nTheater.\n\n75 more replies\n1blckbx\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nHow about banning single use plastic everything?\n\ntickettoride98\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThat will happen one ban at a time... like this one. They're not going to set a date for all single use plastic to be banned, that would cause a lot of problems. Gotta do it one step at a time.\n\n1 more reply\nTouchingEwe\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nHow about not? Especially when a viable alternative isn't available.\n\n42 more replies\naaaaaaaarrrrrgh\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nI hope they start with medical packaging for the instruments used on people who demand idiotic plastic bans.\n\nFun fact: The individual wrapping of cucumbers, often used as an example for \"plastic bad\", is a lot better than the food waste that would happen without it.\n\n6 more replies\nStillPlaysWithSwords\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nIn California we also had a straw ban law go into effect a few years ago. You can still get straws everywhere, the only difference is restaurants, coffee shops, eateries, etc don't automatically hand you straws, you have to ask. Otherwise zero difference. That and all the plastic lids are the sip kind, so the hole is larger and drinks are more likely to spill out.\n\nSuck_My_Turnip\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThat’s not a ban if you can still access plastic straws by asking for them.\n\n1 more reply\naduffin86\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nWho the hell is throwing the straws in the ocean? We have plenty of landfills to take them.\n\n4 more replies\nTexasTornadoTime\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nAwful, just plain awful. Paper straws absolutely suck. They fall apart so quickly and might as well not exist.\n\n16 more replies\nMeeseFleece\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nOnce again the perceived public good is more important than people with disabilities. Some people with disabilities need a pastic straw just to drink. If you don't believe me there is a fantastic video by Jessica Kellgren-Fozard that goes more in depth on this exact topic.\n\n13 more replies\nClockworkAeroplane\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nI use like 3 straws a year. If that.\n\nI use at least 1 plastic bag a day.\n\nI pull plastic shrink wrapping off of every order from Amazon.\n\nI throw away cellophane or other plastic packaging from every single thing I buy.\n\n...And we're banning straws... Which actually only work if they are non-absorbent.\n\n1 more reply\nView more comments\n \n5\nRank by size \nRelated\nWorld News\nforward\nback\nr/mildlyinfuriating\nStarbucks gave me a paper straw with their plastic cup...\n250 upvotes · 41 comments\nr/worldnews\nSurgeons perform world’s first eye transplant on man who suffered electric shock\nlbc.co.uk\n854 upvotes · 42 comments\nr/worldnews\nAntony Blinken offers 'unwavering support' for Guyana amid Venezuelan annexation plan\nupi\n514 upvotes · 65 comments\nr/worldnews\nIsrael shares full list of Palestinians to be released in hostage deal\nnewsweek\n2.1K upvotes · 674 comments\nr/facepalm\nSingle-use plastic straws are wasteful and a source of pollution, so we invented a single-use plastic lid to take their place!\n56 upvotes · 20 comments\nr/Frugal\nPut your stinky trash in resealable plastic bags\n142 upvotes · 36 comments\nr/glasgow\nFood bin frustration\n65 upvotes · 43 comments\nr/worldnews\n'Argentina has non-negotiable sovereignty over the Falklands', country's new right-wing president Javier Milei declares\nlbc.co.uk\n12K upvotes · 2.8K comments\nr/worldnews\nFalkland's sovereignty 'not up for discussion' Britain warns after new Argentinian president vows to 'get them back'\nlbc.co.uk\n5.1K upvotes · 847 comments\nr/worldnews\nFormer PM David Cameron is introduced to the House of Lords as Baron Cameron of Chipping Norton\nlbc.co.uk\n976 upvotes · 249 comments\nr/worldnews\nTantric yoga guru Gregorian Bivolaru charged with human trafficking\ntheguardian\n145 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/worldnews\nWorld to hit 1.4C of warming in record hot 2023\nreuters\n191 upvotes · 49 comments\nr/worldnews\nMagnitude 7.5 earthquake strikes Mindanao, Philippines\nreuters\n244 upvotes · 13 comments\nr/worldnews\nVirgin Atlantic completes first long-haul flight fully powered by sustainable fuel\ncnbc\n190 upvotes · 46 comments\nr/worldnews\nCountries meet in Kenya to thrash out global plastic pollution treaty\ntheguardian\n283 upvotes · 9 comments\nr/worldnews\nLaos is spiraling toward a debt crisis as China looms large.\ncnbc\n153 upvotes · 27 comments\nr/worldnews\nThe world briefly smashed through the 2-degree warming limit for the first time ever\ncnn\n939 upvotes · 227 comments\nr/worldnews\nFirst-ever images prove 'lost echidna' not extinct\nbbc\n379 upvotes · 22 comments\nr/worldnews\nUK authorises gene therapy for blood disorders in world first\nreuters\n116 upvotes · 3 comments\nr/worldnews\nClimate-heating gases reach record highs, UN reports\ntheguardian\n158 upvotes · 12 comments\nr/worldnews\nWorld behind on almost every policy required to cut carbon emissions, research finds\ntheguardian\n382 upvotes · 39 comments\nr/worldnews\nAustralia and Philippines begin joint patrols in South China Sea as regional tensions rise\ntheguardian\n330 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/worldnews\nEU is ill-equipped to meet growing global threats\nreuters\n192 upvotes · 52 comments\nr/worldnews\nPhilippines considers return to 'fold' of International Criminal Court\nreuters\n90 upvotes · 1 comment\nr/worldnews\nOil prices on track for fourth straight week of declines\nreuters\n263 upvotes · 22 comments\nTOP POSTS\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of September 29, 2020\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of September 2020\nReddit\nreReddit: Top posts of 2020"
