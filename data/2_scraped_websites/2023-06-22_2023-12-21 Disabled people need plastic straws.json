I’ve never seen this mentioned and I don’t know if I’m missing something. It seems like it would work- reducing plastic while also having straws for people who need them. Is it that metal straws aren’t flexible like plastic straws or something?\n\nI’m disabled myself so I’m not asking because I don’t believe they’re needed, but because I haven’t seen anyone talk about metal straws and I’m confused.

People with tourette syndrome or epilepsy probably shouldn't use them.\n\nReply\nreply\nShaycat501\n•\n5 mo. ago\n\nIn their own homes, a metal straw might be a usable option.

If the angle on the metal straw is wrong for the disabled person's needs, then there is no way to adjust the angle.\n\nReply\nreply\nGertrudethecurious\n•\n5 mo. ago\n\nYou don't need to use plastic straws. There are 'plastic' biodegradable straws which feel the same.\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/Compostable-Plants-Biodegradable-Drinking-Restaurant/dp/B09DPT4KBR/ref=mp_s_a_1_2_sspa?keywords=Biodegradable+Straw&qid=1689940344\n\nReply\nreply\nbetterworkbitch\n•\n5 mo. ago\n\nFun fact: often people with shellfish allergies cannot use these straws because they contain some sort of sea shell.\n\nReply\nreply\njurassicbond\n•\n5 mo. ago\n•\nEdited 5 mo. ago\n\nWhat kind of disabilities make it harder to use paper straws than plastic straws?\n\nReply\nreply\nCalgaryChris77\n•\n5 mo. ago\n\nI think the idea is that many places are satisfying the law by getting rid of straws completely. You’d have to bring your metal straw with you as well since you wouldn’t get something like that for free with every drink.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/Parenting\nWhy introduce pacifier?\n149 comments\nr/NoStupidQuestions\nDo I really need to use those tissue toilet seat covers?\n2 upvotes · 3 comments\nr/unpopularopinion\nThere’s no point in using straws at restaurants…\n25 upvotes · 120 comments\nr/geek\nBit bending an MRI to play Bach\nyoutube\n140 upvotes · 16 comments\nr/electricians\nCan anyone help me understand why we have a constant debate on wagos vs wire nuts?\n10 upvotes · 36 comments\nr/Documentaries\nWhy Decentralization Matters (2021) - Big tech companies were built off the backbone of a free and open internet.
