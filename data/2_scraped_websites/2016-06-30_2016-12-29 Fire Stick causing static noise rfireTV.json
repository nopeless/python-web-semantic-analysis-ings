Super annoying to drill down through menus, pick a movie only to find the audio is shit and have to reboot, (wait 2 mins) and then find the movie again... IMO my Roku's have been less trouble.\n\ndownwind2020\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nMy Firestick TV makes static often while running the youtube app. When I exit youtube and go back into youtube it often goes away. This didn't happen last year.\n\nRegular TV channels don't have static and the Netflix app doesn't have static.\n\nNone of this involves a phone or a laptop etc.\n\n \nTop 2%\nRank by size \nr/SmarterEveryDay\nThis TRANSPARENT ENGINE is Fascinating (How Engines Work) - Smarter Every Day 292\nyoutube\n203 upvotes · 47 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
