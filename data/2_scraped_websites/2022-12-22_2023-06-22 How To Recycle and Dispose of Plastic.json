But what happens to them once they’re thrown out? Are plastic straws recyclable? The answer is a little more complicated than straightforward.\n\nIn short, yes, plastic straws can be recycled – but the process is not always simple.

It’s imperative to check with your local center before throwing out used plastic straws with your other recyclables. \n\nThere are different types and varying rules regarding the collection and recycling of plastic straws. With even just a small understanding of local policies, you can confirm whether or not your local recycling center accepts straws- before throwing them out in curbside recycling.\n\nSource: Internet\n\n>> Read More:\n\nWhat Are Plastic Straws?

The good news is that some cities and towns across the United States have programs in place that can guide you to recycle plastic straws responsibly. \n\nBefore attempting to recycle your plastic straws, it's important to check with your local municipality or waste management company for specific instructions on how to do so. Different states may have different processes in place;  including what kind of materials can be recycled and where they should be taken. Some locations may not accept plastic straws at all, whilst others may require them to be placed into a separate receptacle from other recyclable items.\n\nIn Los Angeles, plastic straws can be recycled in blue trash bins. They should be put in a recycled plastic bag before being discarded as the straws are lightweight and can be swiftly blown away by the wind.\nIn Denver, plastic straws are not recyclable, so you are required to find another way to dispose of them.\n\nSource: Internet\n\nOther Ways to Dispose of Plastic Drinking Straws At Home\n\nMany local recycling centers may not accept plastic straws or have certain conditions in place surrounding how they should be prepared for disposal. So how can we dispose of straws properly in this situation? As luck may have it, there are still other ways for you to dispose of plastic drinking straws at home if your local recycling centers won’t accept them!\n\nReuse Straws\n\nOne possibility is to reuse the straws by washing them thoroughly before then storing them in a dry place before their next use. Some people occasionally elect to upcycle their plastic straws into useful items such as homemade jewelry or decorations! With a perfect blend of motivation and creativity, these simple materials can be turned into something especially unique and long-lasting! \n\nAnother alternative is the opportunity to find another organization that will accept plastic straw donations. These organizations will repurpose the material for various purposes; such as creating recycled art pieces that further bring awareness to the global plastics problem.\n\nIn case of the aforementioned solutions are inapplicable to you, then you may have to accept the last resort of discarding used straws in the trash. Although this isn't the most environmentally friendly resolution, it's marginally better than leaving used straws lying around or dumping them into nature and facing the risk of polluting the environment. Just ensure your used plastic drinking straws are sorted into separate sealed bags before tossing them in the garbage so they don't end up scattered all over your house or yard.\n\nSource: Internet\n\n>> Read More:\n\n10 Ways To Reduce Plastic Use In Everyday Life\n10 Must-Try Sustainable Products Of 2022\nThe Best Eco-Friendly Alternatives To Plastic That Makes Your Life Greener\nSwitch to Reusable Straws and Compostable Natural Straws\n\nNow that you have stretched your awareness to the limits of these plastic straws, you may understand there are really very limited proper ways to dispose of plastic straws.
