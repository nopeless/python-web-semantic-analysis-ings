If you're storing matches its best to make it a bit longer and add some cotton to the bottom to prevent moisture build up.\n\n2. Ask the matches, cut a thin strip of phosphorus off the matchbox and slide it in with them.\n\n3. In regards to all asking how to open them, just pinch the pointed sides of the fused plastic. It's weak as he'll and should give at some point. All if else fails, use your teeth\nRead more\n8\nReply\n@jeepgirlscozycrafts\n4 years ago\nLoved these for my 1 night hiking/camping trips very light and easy to carry in and out. Also the money is perfect to stash $20 for emergency and keep it in my wallet for EDC and not be tempted to open and use it lol\n4\nReply\n@RealQuickChris\n7 years ago\nGreat video. I put these mini straw kits in all my bags, bottles and tins. They are great.  OMG I forgot you can get honey with a tip that's so much easier.  Your videos are awesome keep them coming.\n10\nReply\n2 replies\n@dawnwilliams8417\n2 years ago\nI found printing the contents in a easy to read font and tapping over the entire label with clear tape works very well. \nReply\n@Waterflame\n8 years ago\nI love this idea! I will probably never do it, since it's so time consuming, but I enjoyed watching your video! :)\n2\nReply\n@YenieD13\n2 years ago\nLove this!\nGoing to also use this for single dose meds for our camping trips.\n1\nReply\n@SillyConeBaby\n7 years ago\nI totally love this!  The money... What a hiding place :D however, easy to misplace :-O \nPerfect portions for say, a camping trip\n13\nReply\n@lockgames5217\n2 years ago\nMany days looking for a diy solution. This is a very clever way, thank you so much\nReply\n@Lambert_Life\n2 years ago\nI use them in this way for most of that stuff plus an improvised fishing kit including some line, sinkers & hooks.  Also works great to keep .22 ammo dry in your pack.  Is great if you're carrying a tube fed .22 rifle.. just cut the end off a straw & in one motion dump seven rounds in the tube at once.\nReply\n@m.sakai_yt\n4 years ago\nThis is a very cool trick! But I cannot recommend this for traveling abroad because I did this and the airport security thought I was smuggling drugs but it still is a good idea in consideration for security. But I can simply recommend is getting a plastic or metal tin with or without dividers. You can purchase these small, medium, large, and extra large tins at your craftshop and if lucky a medica section/travel section at your dollarstore (its a medicine pill container).\nRead more\nReply\n@matthewbrown6163\n4 years ago\nI just made some today using McDonalds shakes straws, These are far thicker so hold more & are free too. These are white so you need to add the contents on the outside.\n2\nReply\n@wval4379\n2 years ago\nI've seen these used a lot. But I've never seen anyone show an easy way to open them without having to have scissors or knife handy.  Is there a way to make them that allows for an easy way to open them without tools?   If you need to open it really quick - honey for someone whose glucose has tanked, cayenne for someone having a stroke, etc. -  it would be good not to need tools, or strong teeth to open.\nRead more\nReply\n1 reply\n@shelleylouise7588\n1 year ago\nexcellent ideas  :)\nReply\n@SillyConeBaby\n7 years ago\nbrilliant hack, it's my favotire and so cute.
