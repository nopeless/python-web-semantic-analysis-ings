Identical setups wrt belts, miners, etc (both are being fed dedicated miner output ore; no splitters). Both constructors have maxed resources inside them. However, one constructor is putting out half as many ingots as the other. No issues with electricity drops or spikes.\n\nWonder what might be going on.\n\nIf I skipped some crucial info, let me know.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT: Yep, it was painfully obvious. The belt with more ingots is mk 1, so it has more time to load it up. Time to fall on my sword. I do wish the belt design between Mk 1 and 2 were a little easier to distinguish though.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/steel-ingot-production-slower-on-one-constructor-than-v0-mcs0zp86qd5c1.png?width=2521&format=png&auto=webp&s=979a5f8c3a5fe1303358c2bef241ab1fb482afc5\n\nView full post\nu/CollisionCourse78\n‚Ä¢\n11 hr. ago\nI mixed regular coal with compacted coal in my miles long conveyor system.

Quite by accident I discovered that RSR is designed to work best when sharpness is set to zero, and by default sharpness is set at around 75% (apparently). After I turned sharpness to zero in the Adrenalin control panel for the game, the trailing sparklies almost completely vanished with no impact to graphics quality.\n\nIf you're dealing with the same issue please give this a try and let me know how it worked out for you.\n\nu/AirNationalGuard\n‚Ä¢\nPromoted\nGuardsmen in the Air National Guard are able to serve wherever they call home and in a role that best suits their skills.\n\nServe Close To Home\n\nairforce.com\nLearn More\nu/Emily_Walters_Fan\n‚Ä¢\n15 hr. ago\nJumping help\n\nI have set jump to right mouse button in the keybindings.

I can download the game and launch, in which case I'm prompted to download C++ libraries for Unreal Engine. I say yes, and the game launches just fine. I can play it until I feel like stopping. As soon as I relaunch the game though, it crashes within 10 seconds. Every time. I've tried forcing DX11, DX12, and Vulkan. I've lowered settings, I've tried everything. The game crashes over and over again within the same time frame every time. It doesn't matter if I quickly try to load into a world, or if I just launch the game and let it sit without clicking anything. It's the same outcome every time.\n\nWhen I uninstall and delete the game directory in .steam/steam/steamapps/common then download the game again, it prompts me to install C++ libraries as previously stated, and the game just works fine. Is there a way for me to fix this without having to constantly download it again? Can I install a particular C++ library on my computer like the game does on it's own? I'm not playing with any mods. I've tested this both on Linux native version and with Steam proton. The only fix I've found yet is to delete and download every time I want to play.\n\nEdit:\nHere's a log from Proton when the game launched. I looked towards the bottom of the file . None of it makes much sense to me. Mostly lines about threads. One line almost at the bottom says \"PreExit Game\" if that means anything to someone. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BVnfvnYNe97-lbSqRHTBJFkJuD-ofT-5/view?usp=sharing\n\nView full post\nu/DCDGaming99\n‚Ä¢\n2 days ago\nWe got a NEW Community Manager!\nu/TheRedFox8118\n‚Ä¢\n2 days ago\nSatisfactory\n\nHi!\n\nA couple of years ago, I had a satisfactory game that was kind of advanced.\n\nMy 7yo is playing too, and at that time he made the mistake of saving his game over mine.
