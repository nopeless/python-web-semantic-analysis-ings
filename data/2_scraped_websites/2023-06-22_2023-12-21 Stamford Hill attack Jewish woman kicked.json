I'm not sure it's antisemitism just because the victim was Jewish. I think the motivation has to be because she was Jewish is my understanding of it. Either way, let's hope they are caught.\n\nIt also says they took her bag which is a motivation in itself.\n\nReply\nreply\n7 more replies\n6 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n1 day ago\nw0kes\n•\n1 day ago\n\nWell right now there is a war in Gaza so she kinda deserved that /s\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nSeanSMEGGHEAD\n•\n1 day ago\n\nDid they know she was Jewish?\n\nIf she wasn't we probably wouldn't be hearing about this attack at all tbh.\n\nLondon is truly a shithole.\n\nReply\nreply\nwuflubuckaroo13\n•\n1 day ago\n\nHey hey, let’s look at it from their point of view!
