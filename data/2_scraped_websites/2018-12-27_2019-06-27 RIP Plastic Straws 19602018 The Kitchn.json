After a long-fought battle against a watertight environmental smear campaign, the plastic straw has officially admitted defeat and commenced its peaceful departure from the public sphere.\n\nNear the end of its life, the sometimes-bendy, oft-bitten, always-disposable drinking aid found itself at odds with eco-minded U.S. cities, fast-food dining establishments, airlines, and the largest coffee chain in the world. With the strong swells of the tide of public opinion against it, the single-use plastic straw will litter our oceans no more (or at least, a lot less).\n\nPrange‚Äôs Sour Cream Cinnamon Sugar Muffins\nThe video player is currently playing an ad.

Decades later in the 1930s, the ‚Äúbendy-straw ‚Äù made its debut, thanks to inventor Joseph Friedman, who had the foresight to create an indented hinge mechanism. This technology was immediately embraced by hospitals, as it allowed patients to drink liquids from their beds.\n\nThe rise of plastic technology in the early 1900s made way for the plastic straw as we know (knew?) it. It wasn‚Äôt until the 1960s that the plastic straw was capable of being mass-produced. Sturdier than paper, cheaper than metal, the plastic straw found its sweet spot in sodas across the country.\n\nDuring what one might call its heyday (i.e., now), 500 million straws are used daily in the U.S. In a world that has reached its plastic saturation point, it‚Äôs time for the plastic straw to ascend to the big milkshake in the sky. (For those it leaves behind, it‚Äôs back to our ancestral roots of metal and paper straws.)\n\nBeloved by iced coffee fanatics, the juice-box set, and liberal-handed waitstaff at casual dining establishments like Applebee‚Äôs, the plastic straw is gone but not forgotten. It leaves behind beloved counterparts including but not limited to the Starbucks Frappuccino, bubble tea, and Capri Sun.\n\nHere‚Äôs What Soup You Should Make, Based on Your Zodiac Sign\nLAUREN MASUR\nPARTNER\nThe Ingredient Swap That Takes Classic Sliders to the Next Level\nWhere to Get Free Coffee on National Coffee Day\nNINA DERWIN\nMeet Haile Thomas, the 18-Year-Old CEO and Vegan Activist Taking Over the World\nLAUREN MASUR\nDuring My Parents‚Äô Custody Battle, Egg Creams Were My Escape\nKIERA WRIGHT-RUIZ\nNicole Taylor's New Book Celebrates Juneteenth and the Joy of Black Cooking\nNICOLE RUFUS\nChip and Joanna Gaines Are Opening a Coffee Shop\nNAOMI TOMKY\nWelcome to Pride Bakeshop: 5 Joyful, Shareable Desserts from Queer Bakers We Love\nTHE KITCHN EDITORS\nMeet Corrie St. Saviour, a Maine Maple Syrup Farmer (Who Never Eats Pancakes)\nLAUREN MASUR\nI‚Äôve Been Studying How Americans Cook for 30 Years.
