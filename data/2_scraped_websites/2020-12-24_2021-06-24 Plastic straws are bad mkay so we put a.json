Also, the fishing industry (corporations) receive around 37.5 billion in subsides while world hunger can be stamped out with around 35 billion. Just food for thought.\n\nEdit: Watch the doc on Netflix, Seapiracy. The creator visits The Plastic Pollution Coalition and gets kicked out by Diana Cohen for confronting her on the fact that they won‚Äôt acknowledge that straws are a fraction of the problem. The thing is, she‚Äôs an artist using an agenda to push her own path. It‚Äôs kind of disgusting.\n\nEdit dos: Why am I getting downvoted?

It costs too much to process them for the amount of reusable material they gain. And recycling plants, for better or for worse, are still for-profit organizations, so...\n\nLarger plastic items, like cups, don't have that problem.\n\n6 more replies\nthe100rabh\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nWhy is this even facepalm, at least some percentage less of plastic\n\nnastafarti\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nIn Canada, we're shooting for zero plastic waste by 2030. The first phase is \"a ban on harmful single-use plastic items where there is evidence that they are found in the environment, are often not recycled, and have readily available alternatives. Based on those criteria, the six items the Government proposes to ban are plastic checkout bags, straws, stir sticks, six-pack rings, cutlery, and food ware made from hard-to-recycle plastics.\"\n\nSo I'm assuming that styrofoam or other #6 and #7 plastics are also on the chopping block. The rest of your cup should be recycleable.\n\n2 more replies\nDanielle082\n‚Ä¢\n3 yr. ago\n\nIts a start and at least they are doing that.
