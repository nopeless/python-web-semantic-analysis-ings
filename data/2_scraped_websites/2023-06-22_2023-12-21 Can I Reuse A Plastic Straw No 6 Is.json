Thank you.\n\nArticle Content\n\nI remember using plastic straws to drink soft drinks as a child. Probably you used them too. We discarded them anyhow we saw fit thinking they will decompose. How naive we must have been. Still yet, these straws are used and thrown away after a single use. In the US alone, 500 million straws are discarded daily. That’s to show how ubiquitous plastic straws are in our environment. \n\nUnknown to many, these plastic straws are not environmentally friendly and pose a threat to the environment and all that lives in them. Worst still, they take a very long time to decompose. The reality is that those plastic straws we used as kids are probably lying around somewhere. And guess what, it will outlive us and our great-grandchildren. \n\nFaced with this problem, it becomes a thing of concern to know if there are other ways plastics can be reused. But before we dive in, let’s look at the concept of plastic and then plastic straws.  \n\nPLASTICS STRAWS\n\nJust as the name implies, plastic straws are made of plastic. They are small and lightweight and come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Plastics and by extension, plastic straws are made of materials that don’t decompose easily.\n\nUnfortunately, these single-use plastics are littered in our surroundings. They end up as landfill and pose a danger to us, our land, pollute the atmosphere when they come in contact with direct sunlight, and finally end up in the water bodies to harm the aquatic animals. The worst of it all is that most of them are not recycled. So we are left with just one option and that’s to find ways to reuse them.\n\nYou Might Also Like:   7 Simple Household Items That Can Be Recycled?\nWAYS TO REUSE STRAWS\n\nUnknown to many people, plastic straws can be reused unlike the idea of reusable dental floss.

Hair Curler\n\nAre you tired of carrying straight hair and need some waves in it? Plastic straws will do the job perfectly. \n\nIt’s very simple to do, part your slightly damp hair into sections and curl your hair around the straw and secure it with a pin. After some time, lose it and you have your waves.\n\n4. Vacuum Sealer\n\nFood lasts longer in the freezer and maintains its quality when they are vacuum sealed. Getting vacuum sealer and bags are less affordable. But you can still store your food without air spoiling it by using a ziplock and a drinking straw. \n\nHere’s what to do, put the food you want to store in a  ziplock with your straw at one end of the bag. Then seal the bag till you reach where the straw is. Use the straw to suck out the air in the bag and your food is ready to be put in the freezer.\n\n5. Label Cords\n\nPlastic straws can be used to label cords. If you have many cords that are plugged in like a television cord, laptop cord, or decoder cord. You can easily confuse them with one another. So use a plastic straw to differentiate them. \n\nYou Might Also Like:   Can You Recycle Styrofoam? 6 Eco-friendly Ways To Reuse Styrofoam\n\nGet a pair of scissors and cut the straw into smaller pieces.

Make A Mock Bouquet With Straws\n\nUsed straws can be used to decorate a space like an office or a home. Gather a handful of colored straws and tie them together in the middle with a ribbon. \n\nThe center of the straw will stick out in multiple directions that look like a flower. Put them in a vase and you have succeeded in beautifying your space. \n\n8. Make A Single-Use Dispenser \n\nAre you about to travel and no space is remaining in your bag? Yet you haven’t put in your cream. At this point, you don’t know what to do. So many questions run throw your mind. How do I carry my cream along?
