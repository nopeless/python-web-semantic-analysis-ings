  "body": "The answer to most question in the form \"Why do we not do obvious good thing\" is cost. It also has to do with the manufacturing process. Those cereal bags don't come to the factory as individual bags. They come as a giant roll of plastic, and a machine separates and seals each one automatically.",

But for other cereals, I used to have a cereal Tupperware container. Pour it in and it's airtight. It also has a spout so you can pour it easily. I don't know why other cereals don't have reclosable bags.\n\n2 more replies\nDonGeronimo\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nit is, sort of\n\n17 more replies\niamofnohelp\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nAs mentioned, cost is probably #1.\n\nBut when crumbs get in the zipper, the bag doesn't always lock that well.\n\nSo effectiveness could be a second reason.\n\n4 more replies\nGeistMD\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nSo it will go bad quickly and force you to buy more.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nSally brand cereal comes in a resealable bag without a box.\n\n1 more reply\ncakeandbeer\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nITT: People who don't use chip clips.\n\nClariceAKALittleMama\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nThis question was just asked on a podcast I listen to.... they decided it's probably so it spoils faster and you have to buy more.\n\ngoopa\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nSome of it is! Sometimes, I like to buy myself what I like to call \"organic junk-food\" sugary granola. Some brands come in ziplock bags. Like this one: https://i3.pureformulas.net/images/product/large/organic-apple-cinnamon-granola-cereal-1lb-454-grams-by-go-raw.jpg\n\ngeologistmane\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nAnother idea is you can stack boxes on shelves, trucks, trains whatever. Bags eh not so much.\n\ncourteous_coitus\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nMost definitely cost.\n\nsexdeer\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nWhy would a company make their food last longer? It causes people to buy more cereal when the cereal goes bad.\n\nKauzrae\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nCheap ass cereal usually comes with a ziploc.\n\nedpotts\n•\n8 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 8 yr. ago\n\nCost and tampering issues. No one wants to get sued.\n\nEdit: Honestly curious, why was I downvoted? The reason \"tamper-resistant\" and \"tamper-evident\" seals are all over the place is because people have been poisoned. Someone puts some poison powder into a food package and closes the lid. They set it back on the shelf. Someone purchases it, and gets poisoned. This rarely happens now, but it used to be more common before tamper protection.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago\nLeporad\n•\n8 yr. ago\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/kurzgesagt\nTHE LAST THING THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN\nyoutube\n132 upvotes · 33 comments\nr/neopets\nI JUST GOT WHAT FROM FAERIE RECYCLING?!?!?!\n147 upvotes · 34 comments\nr/geek\nBit bending an MRI to play Bach\nyoutube\n138 upvotes · 16 comments\nPROMOTED\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
