But they're not even remotely as bad as the wood spoons for the sundaes. That's like...Nails on a chalkboard turned into a utensil.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nitsliightz\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nMan I hated the paper straws alsways used a plastic one when I got home.\n\nReply\nreply\nprolapsedhorseanus\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nWe started bringing our own plastic straws. Drinking a frozen margarita or milkshake with a thin paper straw is not possible.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nPeople complaining about the paper ones, eat the plastic one then. At least the animals won't have to 😌♥️\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\ncyber_cober\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nI drank my coke from a paper straw yesterday and did not like it. I'd rather use pasta as a straw or just a classic plastic one. Luckily I don't do take out that much.\n\nReply\nreply\nKSIForeheadBIG\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nWhy don’t we just get rid of straws?\n\nReply\nreply\n8 more replies\n83Isabelle\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nAs much as I dislike the use of plastic and it's balast on nature, I, and many people I know have the opinion that this is one thing you can't replace by carton straws. If you leave these carton straws in your drink just for one minute you'll be drinking your soda with carton vessels in it... It becomes more frustrating when you realize the top of the cup (why do we need it anyway?!) is still made of plastic, and nobody gives a fuck about it, while this thing normally hardly touches your drink at all.\n\nTalking about alternatives, the bamboo ones break easily, and the reusable ones, I personally, find unhygienic (you can't properly clean the inside)... There is a lot of plastic things that can still be replaced with environmental friendly alternatives, but I have my doubts abouts straws\n\nReply\nreply\ntfrw\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nIt’s because staws become little daggers to wildlife, there are too many videos of turtles having straws removed from their nostrils\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\n10RndsDown\n•\n2 yr. ago\n\nWhy not just make sippy cup styled lids. Sure the lid is plastic. But now there's no need for a straw. U can even have a plastic cap on the top. Sure it probably makes it a bit more complex, but it rids one thing instead of having two.\n\nReply\nreply\nView more comments\n \n23\nRank by size \nr/todayilearned\nTIL: The Prionailurus rubiginosus or \"Rusty Spotted Cat\" is the world's smallest cat.
