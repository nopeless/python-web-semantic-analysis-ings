The UK produced 99 kilograms of plastic waste(2) per person, per year, second only to the US, which produce 105 kilograms.\n\nThe plastic timeline\n\nFrom the graph, you can see the rise of plastic production is in line with population growth. This also correlates with the fact that laws relating to plastic only started to become more common from 2006.\n\nBut, as the key talking points show, there’s plenty to discuss when it comes to the plastic timeline.\n\nKey talking points\nNeil Armstrong plants a nylon flag on the moon in 1969 as plastic starts to become a go-to material in the 1970s.\nIn 1977, the plastic bag was introduced to the grocery industry as an alternative to the paper bag—something we’re trying to revert back to 40-plus years later.\nProduction takes a noticeable dip as laws start to be introduced.\n2008 was a noticeable period on the timeline. In this year, global production dropped as China announced a ban on supermarkets handing out plastic bags in shops(3), instead telling people to use paper or cloth sacks to carry their shopping. Retailers faced prosecution if they were found to be providing them to grocery shoppers.\n\nAs shown on the timeline, global laws started to become more common. At least 23 laws, levies or pieces of legislation were introduced between 2008 and 2010 in 21 different countries.\n\nLaws reach their peak, but production surpasses population\n\nLaws started to reach their peak around 2017. Free disposable plastic bags were banned in Catalonia, and Slovenia rolled this ban out on a national level.\n\nBut plastic production started to surpass population growth at this time. The reason? Well, global e-commerce sales totalled $2.38 billion in 2017, hitting $3.54 billion last year. The online boom comes with the need for packaging, which is often plastic.\n\nNew laws start to decline despite production increase\n\nFrom 2018, new laws started to tail off, but production and population levels continued to rise. This may be due to the fact that certain laws, levies and legislation had been introduced in previous years, but it opens the debate that there’s still work to be done in order to help solve the world’s plastic problem.\n\nThere are encouraging signs though. In October 2020, a UK ban on the supply of plastic straws, stirrers and plastic-stemmed cotton buds came into force.\n\nThe ban was introduced after it was revealed the UK was using 4.7 billion single-use straws(4), 316 million plastic stirrers and 1.8 billion plastic-stemmed cotton buds each year.\n\nUK plastic laws\n\nLike many other countries, the UK already has a levy on the use of plastic bags in shops. When the levy was introduced in Northern Ireland back in 2013, usage dropped by 71% in just one year. Scotland followed in 2014 and England in 2015—with the rule mandatory for companies who employed over 250 members of staff.\n\nIn November this year, Liberal Democrat MP Alistair Carmichael re-introduced the Plastics Pollution Bill(5), which calls for a 2025 target to end “non-essential single-use plastics”.\n\nPlastic facts over the years\n\nOver the years, plastic has been produced by many industries across the world and used in everyday items. Here’s a list of some historic plastic facts over the years.\n\n1862: Plastic starts to be used in households(6) for items like knife handles\n1950: Tupperware parties start to become a trend(7)\n1982: Grocery chains Kroger and Safeway replace their paper bags with plastic(8)\n1997: Charles Moore discovers the Great Pacific Garbage Patch(9)—the world’s largest collection of floating plastic waste\n2002: 360 million bottles are recycled(10)\n2008: Plastic bottles achieve a 27% recycling rate(11), reclaiming 2.4 billion pounds of plastic\n2016: A global population of 7 billion produces over 320 million tonnes of plastic(12)—with the figure expected to double by 2034.\n2019: University College London launches its Plastic Waste Innovation Hub(13) and the Big Compost Experiment\n\nGoing forward, innovation needs to be at the heart of solving the world’s plastic problem. For industries who ship items online, it can be a case of improving supply chains through the use of a reusable plastic pallet—where vehicle fill can be improved by up to 42 per cent.\n\n \n\nSources\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/282732/global-production-of-plastics-since-1950/\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/oct/30/us-and-uk-citizens-are-worlds-biggest-sources-of-plastic-waste-study\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/jan/09/china.plasticbags\nhttp://randd.defra.gov.uk/Default.aspx?Menu=Menu&Module=More&Location=None&ProjectID=20086&FromSearch=Y&Publisher=1&SearchText=EQ0115&SortString=ProjectCode&SortOrder=Asc&Paging=10\nhttps://www.packagingnews.co.uk/top-story/new-bill-aims-widen-single-use-plastic-bans-06-11-2020\nhttp://tryforgood.com/plastic-timeline-the-good-and-the-evil/\nhttps://www.history.com/news/tupperware-parties-brownie-wise\nhttps://www.plasticsmakeitpossible.com/about-plastics/history-of-plastics/plastic-innovations-in-packaging-through-the-decades/\nhttps://www.ecowatch.com/plastics-history-ecological-crisis-2560978473.html\nhttp://www.historyofplastic.com/plastic-facts/facts-about-plastic/\nhttps://www.bigcompostexperiment.org.uk/about/timeline-of-composting-and-biodegradable-plastics\nhttps://www.sas.org.uk/our-work/plastic-pollution/plastic-pollution-facts-figures/\nhttps://www.bigcompostexperiment.org.uk/about/timeline-of-composting-and-biodegradable-plastics\nFacebook\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nPrint\nEditor's Recommended Articles\nMust Read >> Bioplastic is no safer than conventional plastic, according to new study\nMust Read >> COVID-19 is exacerbating an already worrying plastic pollution problem\nMust Read >> Plastic waste: Being part of the solution, not the pollution\nMust Read >> How can consumers cut down on unnecessary plastic waste?\nTAGS\nEnvironment\nPlastic Pollution\nRELATED ARTICLES\nDo electric eels have the power to drive genetic modification?\nNeed for an integrated approach to combat soil degradation\nHidden role of plant waxes in environmental communication\nClimate, Green Deal, environment and oceans\nDelaying action on decarbonisation makes innovation absolutely critical\nLeaked documents reveal UAE’s plans to promote oil deals during COP28\nLEAVE A REPLY\n\nSave my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.\n\nRelated Academic Articles\nInnovating polymers: 100% recycled ECOPLASTOMER®\nDecember 8, 2023\nToxic textiles: Potential health risks associated with toxic chemicals in clothing\nDecember 7, 2023\nTurid Rustad: Navigating the seas of seafood processing\nDecember 5, 2023\nFollow Open Access Government\nLatest Environment Reports\nGreen hydrogen production offshore: developing accepted solutions\nOctober 20, 2022\nRenewable energy: Next generation solar power\nAugust 20, 2021\nUtilise district heating data and get an immediate climate-positive effect\nJuly 25, 2021\nWind Turbine Foundation inspection using Coda Octopus 3_D Echoscope\nAugust 27, 2020\nLatest Environment eBooks\nBuilding a digital city with several digital twins?\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\nDecember 6, 2023\nClimate Diplomacy and EU Example\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\nNovember 23, 2023\nGERICS Climate Outlook at county level\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\nNovember 10, 2023\nDirect root-zone: A novel form of subsurface irrigation delivery in vineyards\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\nNovember 8, 2023\n \nPlease Choose\nSearch Everything\nArticles\neBooks\nPublications\nSpecial Reports\nStakeholders\n \nUseful Resources\nPublications\nStakeholders\neBooks\nSpecial Reports\nQuick Links\nContact Us\nAbout Us\nOur Editors\nOur Audience\nPrestige Contributors\nTestimonials\nFeature Articles\nBaywater Healthcare: The positive outcomes of a virtual ward solution\nDecember 8, 2023\nHow EVs and charging networks shape tomorrow’s cities\nDecember 8, 2023\nWhat temperature should my medical fridge be?\nDecember 8, 2023\nWhy cloud technology is essential to policing and the wider public...\nDecember 7, 2023\nLatest Publication\nOpen Access Government October 2023\nQuick Launch Publication More Details\nOctober 10, 2023\nLatest eBook\nAlternative broadband delivery solutions\nQuick Launch eBook More Details\nDecember 6, 2023\nABOUT US\nOpen Access Government produces compelling and informative products for a wide audience.
