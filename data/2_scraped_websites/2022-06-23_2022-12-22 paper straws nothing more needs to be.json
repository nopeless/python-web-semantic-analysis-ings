Drinks like soda are fine for paper straws. The solution? Reusable metal straws. Don't break, good for the environment and really cheap in shops\n\nuncle_bumblefuck_\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nOk but still doesn't solve the problem of all the boys in your yard.\n\n1 more reply\nTalentati\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nI've tried many metal straws but there must be something wrong with me because no matter the drink, I always taste metal lol\n\n5 more replies\ntheoutdoorkat1011\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nMetal straws are grand until you bust a tooth because you’re a clutz.

When I go get a slush from 711 the staff always tell me \" you forgot your straw\" and I always tell them \"no I didnt\" then walk away.
