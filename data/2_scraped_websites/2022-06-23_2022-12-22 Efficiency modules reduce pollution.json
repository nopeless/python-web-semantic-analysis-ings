That's why I don't put them in forestry's. If you can put speed modules into them then they absorb a lot more pollution though.\n\nReply\nreply\nZaflis\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nIt works a little backwards, we have these greenhouses from K2 that absorb pollution from atmosphere instead of generating it by 5/m. When you add 2 Eff 1 modules it goes \"up\" to -0.8 absorbed, instead of increasing. Actually it would make sense if it remained the same -5.\n\nAlso i really don't know if this issue is to be tackled by devs or mod creator.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nIt’s raised on the K2 discord a lot of times but it can’t be fixed. A negative polution modifier is increased by speed/prod modules and decreased by eff modules, because it’s a basic multiplication.\n\nReply\nreply\n17 more replies\nDeadlypandaghost\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nAlways the mod creator. A developer is only responsible for their built in modding tools working. The modder is responsible for compatibility between their mod and the game.\n\nReply\nreply\n3 more replies\nescafrost\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nSpeed modules.\n\nReply\nreply\nGuava-King\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThrow production modules instead?\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nRelated\nFactorio\nAction game\nGaming\nforward\nback\nr/technology\nNew Solar Panel Design Uses Wasted Energy to Make Water From Air\nmsn\n78 upvotes · 4 comments\nr/factorio\nAre efficiency modules worth it?\n10 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/factorio\nHow Hard is it to Beat Factorio in HELL?\nyoutube\n579 upvotes · 68 comments\nr/energy\nGame-Changing Carbon Capture Technology To Remove 99% of CO2 From Air\nscitechdaily\n80 upvotes · 49 comments\nr/Factoriohno\nThe absolute shortest possible way to explain how trains work.
