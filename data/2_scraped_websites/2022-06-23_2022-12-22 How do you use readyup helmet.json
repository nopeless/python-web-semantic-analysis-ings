In fact it' more of a gimmick, the lore states that people wear these in Lorville to combat the huge amount of air pollution there. It's like the 2952 version of a covid mask.",

I cant find anything anywhere on this.\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nLord-Rufus\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThe Ready-Up is a hat manufactured by Gyson Inc.. It is a popular budget softshell helmet made primarily of industrial-strength plastic. It barely met United Empire of Earth standards and received the lowest rating possible from Whitley’s Guide.[1] Although it is advertised as a pressurized helmet, it does not provide any life support thus the player will suffocate when wearing one in depressurized area.[2][3]\n\nReply\nreply\nisogyre01\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThe Ready-Up is technically a piece of clothing, iirc, and so you can't wear it with an undersuit/other armor, only other clothing.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nOk so it dose not work in zero G\n\nReply\nreply\n2 more replies\nbeydo12\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThat's the fun part- you don't\n\nReply\nreply\nalaskanwilly\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nThe description makes it sound like it does work in zero G, however I guess it would be more for on the ship and you lose pressure/oxygen... but yeah it reads like should work imo. Lol\n\nReply\nreply\nRedNozomi\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nPresumably it works fine in zero G, just not in zero oxygen.\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n1 yr. ago\n\nsadly the ready-up helmet doesn't make a hermetic seal with your neck / isn't airtight. So it won't work in a vacuum or a non-breathable atmosphere; even though it certainly should.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nRelated\nStar Citizen\nMMO\nSpace combat game\nGaming\nAction game\nforward\nback\nr/starcitizen\nRINGS II: a documentary on star citizens toxic underworld\nyoutube\n217 upvotes · 136 comments\nr/starcitizen\nSPOILER\n3.22 Vulture Salvaging Quick Video\n109 upvotes · 53 comments\nr/starcitizen\nOfficial videos are in the expo brochures: Garman Humble: Security Professional - Part 1\nyoutube\n317 upvotes · 53 comments\nr/bikewrench\nHow do I get this open without any special tool?\n73 upvotes · 113 comments\nr/starcitizen\nIllegal and Toxic actions by an Org - LevelCapGaming\nyoutube\n767 upvotes · 512 comments\nr/intotheradius\nIs the helmet necessary?\n12 upvotes · 17 comments\nr/YUROP\nthey won't let me bring my custom glock\n1.8K upvotes · 70 comments\nr/cyberpunkgame\ncan you get the Trauma Team armor in game?\n2.1K upvotes · 95 comments\nr/starcitizen\nInside Star Citizen: Arrasted Development\nyoutube\n284 upvotes · 123 comments\nr/starcitizen\nQuantum Travel tests\nyoutube\n463 upvotes · 118 comments\nr/starcitizen\nSPOILER\nIDRIS INTERIOR renders datamined - Leak\n225 upvotes · 92 comments\nr/starcitizen\nSPOILER\nStar Citizen Evo Leaks - Replication Layer Test #3\n321 upvotes · 29 comments\nr/starcitizen\nSPOILER\nEvo Salvage Leaks part 2\n306 upvotes · 174 comments\nr/starcitizen\nThe updated Anvil Aerospace Osprey Brochure [Fan concept]\n763 upvotes · 180 comments\nr/starcitizen\nGatac Syulen - 3D models and renders from latest PTU patch\n425 upvotes · 167 comments\nr/starcitizen\nDrake Caterpillar Essentials Edition (kit-bashed rendering)\n445 upvotes · 100 comments\nr/starcitizen\nThe ability to combine colors from flares to create the correct corresponding color is so cool.
