It’s such a feeling to be understood!\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\n666pool\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThere was another thread about gluten in paper straws and this got brought up. I feel like if the bartender is handling a pasta straw after making each drink, there’s going to be gluten cross contamination all over that bar. I wouldn’t feel safe ordering anything besides maybe a cider in a sales glass bottle.\n\nReply\nreply\n19 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nYou could bring your own straws.
