People need to graduate elementary schools before going to high schools.\n\nReply\nreply\nfokum8\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nYep http://puu.sh/kTqTl/21f4baf6ba.jpg\n\nReply\nreply\n4 more replies\nZulathan\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nI don't think adults tend to go to elementary schools unless the policy is active, meaning the adults stay uneducated and their kids go to school.\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nIt takes time. More time than I think is necessary but still...time.\n\nReply\nreply\nDanzaDragon\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nWhen you get used to 4x or 8x aging the vanilla speeds for aging and education seem really fast :P\n\nReply\nreply\nHydraslik\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nI don't think adults/seniors are ever qualified for receiving education, but they make up a lot of the early population in your city.

Thankfully now we can zone/policy to fix that.\n\nReply\nreply\n4 more replies\nscatterbrain666\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nYeah you just have to wait. I start a new city and commercial always needs more educated workers. It's rather annoying having to destroy businesses.
