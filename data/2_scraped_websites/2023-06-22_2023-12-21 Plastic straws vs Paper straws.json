Unless its something like boba or a smoothie that needs a straw the no straw solves it. I work in a bar and only give straws to people who ask for them which is maybe 1 out of 10.\n\nI also carry a stainless steel one in case I get a drink and want or need a straw but you should consider that you have to use one 100 times before it offsets what it took to make it. So maybe worth it if you will actually use it a lot otherwise maybe not.\n\nSame with reusable shopping bags. I hate plastic bag waste but we don't need to keep making more reusable bags because that's not helping either. Use them if you have them but stop buying them. Or just keep a laundry basket or cardboard box in your trunk and put your groceries directly into that and carry the whole thing in your house.\n\nI think about this stuff all the time, I hate plastic waste üòê\n\nhttps://www.choosefinch.com/blog/the-sustainability-paradox-the-pros-and-cons-of-doing-good\n\nThis article is useful to anyone interested in this stuff\n\n3 more replies\nDyeeguy\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nI should post my unpopular opinion about paper straws, cuz i have no issue with them whatsoever. Works fine hours later. I feel like I‚Äôm being gaslit by all of society on that one. Y‚Äôall must be deepthroating or chewing on the straw\n\nstepheno125\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nThe carbon output required to make paper straws is like two or three orders of magnitude higher than plastic straws and climate change is more of an existential threat than straws in that ocean. Also most plastic in the ocean is from mixed plastic recycling from the US and EU being sent to SE Asia where the valuable shit is picked out and the rest is dumped‚Ä¶ And on the list of non valuable plastic items straws are probably at the top.\n\nPlastic in the landfill is not ideal but not abjectly harmful. Recycling mixed plastic waste, half of which is not recyclable is. Honestly we should probably just burn all mixed plastic and turn it into electricity. It‚Äôs better than coal‚Ä¶\n\nUse reusable damn straws. If that is not an option, use plastic ones and make sure they go into the trash not the recycling bin.\n\n4 more replies\nAutoModerator\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nPlease remember what subreddit you are in, this is unpopular opinion.

Both suck, just get a reusable straw, these should just be used instead anyways, as the packaging for paper straws is going to create just as much waste as shipping plastic ones anyways.\n\n4 more replies\nthickhipstightlips\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nWhat about stainless steel straws ?\n\n2 more replies\n[deleted]\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n[deleted]\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\nZempshir\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nI can see you‚Äôre just talking about preference which is fine but the whole debate around it is really stupid to me.\n\nWhy are plastic straws specifically what everyone points to? They‚Äôre usually used with plastic or styrofoam cups so why is the straw the first concern? Not to mention all the other non-biodegradable things we throw away.\n\nThe main concern is straws ending up in the ocean, which happens almost entirely because of China purposefully dumping that shit into the ocean, including our recycling so why don‚Äôt we stop sending that shit to them and also sanction the hell out of them for that on top of their insane air pollution and blatant human rights abuses. I could only see it making sense to ban plastic straws at places right by the beach.\n\nUnusual_Individual93\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nGiving me a paper straw with a huge plastic cup just makes no sense. Just give me the plastic straw with the plastic cup.\n\n29erRider5000G\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nHow about not using a straw like an adult?\n\nJeniCzech_92\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nMetal, reusable straws. Period.\n\nstepheno125\n‚Ä¢\n24 days ago\n\nOut of things that put micro plastics into your body, plastic straws are going to be pretty damn far down the list. Paper straws also are several orders of magnitude worse in terms of carbon emissions. Also the reason plastic straws end up in turtles noses is that people throw them into mixed plastic recycling bins. This mixed plastic waste is then shipped to SE Asia to be sorted. At a lot of these facilities they pick out the 10-30% that is actually commercially viable to recycle and dump the rest into rivers which lead to the ocean.\n\nMoral of the story is that paper straws suck. We should probably just burn for power/landfill mixed plastic waste as a whole, but if you are going to use a straw, paper is probably the worst option unless you throw your plastic one into the recycling bin not the trash. Even then it is questionable because more turtles are going to die of climate change than straws.\n\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/unpopularopinion\nPeople fuss too much over caring for their cast iron\n8.3K upvotes ¬∑ 854 comments\nr/unpopularopinion\nFinal exams should not be 50 percent of your grade\n7.7K upvotes ¬∑ 1.6K comments\nr/unpopularopinion\nGun Buy Backs should be required to have experts present to appraise the value of any guns brought in.
