Factors, such as their impact on the environment, their functionality, accessibility, and more are incredibly important. So, let’s dive into the debate of bamboo straws versus plastic straws.\n\nWhat Are They and How Are They Made?\n\nBefore we get into the nitty-gritty of it all, let’s start with the basics. What exactly are they and how are they made?\n\nWhat Are Bamboo Straws?\n\nA sustainable, organic, compostable, and 100% biodegradable option, bamboo straws are a type of reusable straw. These straws first hit the market in the year 2012. They were introduced as a sustainable solution to the plastic straw problem. Bamboo straws, as the name suggests, are plant-based straws, which makes them an eco-friendly straw option. This also makes them a great BPA-free option that is free of toxic chemicals.\n\nBamboo Straws\nHow Is A Bamboo Straw Made?\n\nOf course, it doesn’t take a whole lot of brain power to figure out that bamboo straws are made from the bamboo plant. Although, it is important to know how exactly is it made to understand how natural and sustainable the straw is.\n\nThe process of making bamboo straws is incredibly sustainable. A bamboo straw is made using organic, natural bamboo that comes directly from the bamboo plant. It is essentially a flowering plant, which you can find easily in nature, mainly in forests. Once a bamboo plantation has grown to its natural capacity, it is considered ready to be harvested.\n\nOnce the farmers are done harvesting it, the harvest is washed in hot boiling water. This allows the plant to be sterilized before it is dried. Since the bamboo plant has a natural hole running through the middle, there isn’t much processing required. So, all that is left for the bamboo is for it to be handcrafted into bamboo straws.\n\nAdvantages of Using Bamboo For Straws\nMake Durable and Reusable Bamboo Straws\n\nBamboo straws are plant-based. In fact, the bamboo plant is one that grows in wet and humid locations. So, it is greatly resistant to liquids and does not break down easily. The water-resistant properties are also transferred onto the handcrafted straws as well due to the lack of processing. This is why reusable bamboo straws are durable and able to maintain their integrity.\n\nFree of Chemicals\n\nThe bamboo plant itself does not require any pesticides or chemicals. So, this reusable straw is free of toxic chemicals. This is definitely not the case for plastic products.\n\nSustainable\n\nThe bamboo plant, if not taken out of the soil, has the ability to regrow. This means that farmers do not need to replant bamboo plants over and over again. So, the fertility of the soil is not hampered with each harvest. Since bamboo plants are also harvested from forests, their ability to regrow does not contribute to deforestation.\n\nContact Us\nWhat Are Plastic Straws?\n\nPlastic straws are non-biodegradable straws that you can purchase all over the world. These straws are single-use straws, which means that they do not fall within the category of reusable straws. They are most often seen in fast food chains, cafes, and other types of eateries.\n\nPlastic straws\n\nPlastic straws were once a very convenient product. However, due to their nature, they have since become a nuisance on our planet. These throw-away straws create a significant amount of waste by filling up our landfills. This pollution is driven by one factor, that is, the material used for their construction.\n\nWhat Are Plastic Straws Made Of?\n\nWe all know that plastic straws are made of plastic. However, only a few of us understand what plastic actually is. The plastic used to make these straws is a smooth polymer, most commonly polypropylene. This is essentially a fuel, which is made up of atoms of carbon and hydrogen and requires an entire chemical process.\n\nDisadvantages of Using Plastic For Straws\nNot Eco Friendly\n\nPlastic is known to have devastating effects on our planet. This is largely due to the fact that the polymer used is not biodegradable. So, instead of degrading into nature, like bamboo, it will instead break down into microplastics.\n\nNon-Reusable Straws\n\nSince these straws are not reusable straws, you will find a large quantity of them in production. This will also create a large amount of waste on a daily basis. Since the plastic will not degrade naturally, these non-reusable straws will accumulate over time in landfills.\n\nTheir Impact on The Environment\n\nA straw will either be eco-friendly or not eco-friendly. Its impact on the environment depends on the material that it is made from. Both bamboo and plastic straws have a significant impact on our planet.
