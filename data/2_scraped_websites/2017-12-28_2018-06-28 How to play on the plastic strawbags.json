In generally covers lots of plastic alternative products as most are made of paper products. Investing more specifically is tough because most pulp mills are owned by bigger companies like IP which are included in WOOD, most paper bags are made by similar companies, idr which. There are more influences than just that, but you’re definitely late to the party (check graph starting Jan 2016).\n\nAlso, make you’ll make a fortune if this actually happens\n\nReply\nreply\n1 more reply\nwilliam_fontaine\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nGotta buy the non-plastic straw ETF.\n\nReply\nreply\nzhantoo\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nYou mean non-plastic straw and bags..
