My question is, is it worth while? Iâ€™m primarily fishing for trout/salmon. I donâ€™t really care about LM or SM bass, and I use an ocean rod for catfish. I was catching trout consistently on a trout magnet, which is what made me wonder if a baitcaster would be a good investment, so I can use my spinning reel for a different rig.\n\nu/Exact-Celebration542\nâ€¢\n22 hr. ago\nKinda went all in...Merry Christmas to me?\nFunny\nu/Meech7561\nâ€¢\n22 hr. ago\nMiddle Finger Bobbers\nGear Pictures\nu/MtnDewOfficial\nâ€¢\nPromoted\nSo you want to know what it takes to make a new Mtn Dew flavor?\nu/cactusandbutter\nâ€¢\n5 hr. ago\nAre the Chinese made penn senators any good\nQuestion\n\nThinking bout picking up a penn senator are the new Chinese made ones good?\n\nu/iamtheramcast\nâ€¢\n1 day ago\nBought a mystery box, these were in it.

Heâ€™s been fishing three times a week for about six months now and feels he is ready for a baitcaster. Iâ€™ve identified the Daiwa Fuego CT as a good one for him (Daiwa store on amazon has it for $83 right now). Can anyone recommend a decent rod to pair with it? I was hoping to come out under $130 for the combo, but Iâ€™m not sure how realistic that is as Iâ€™m not a fisherman myself.
