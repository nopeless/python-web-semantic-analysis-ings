(Not to discount OP, whatsoever - to each his/her own.) I'm more about recycling my buttons from old clothes. I always cut them off and keep them in a nice vintage ball jar. I have quite a collection and if I need one or more that doesn't have a match I'll often replace all the buttons with different ones so it looks intentional. The leftover shirt or pants gets used for other things - cut up for rags mostly.\n\n1 more reply\n_arkoudaki\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThis is the tutorial : https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=dPhty9-T0mY 0:21\n\n1 more reply\nDoctorTobogggan\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nBring on the down votes but this is a nonsense way to spend time and effort to try to help the environment.\n\n2 more replies\nkissapuppy\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI would love to find out how you made this!\n\nwhat_is_perspective\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nI love zero waste but am I the only person who thinks this is dumb af?\n\n1 more reply\n[deleted]\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nHow the hell do you drink with 'em?\n\nbrown-eye_guy\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nGood job, now throw them in the trash.\n\n1 more reply\nLittleGlovesDavid\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nHow??\n\nwoosterthunkit\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nThis is super cool\n\nhagamuffn\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nDope\n\nsoggycedar\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nWhat did you use them for?\n\n1 more reply\nthatG_evanP\n•\n4 yr. ago\n\nWhy are there black dots on them?
