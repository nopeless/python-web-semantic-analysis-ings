This game is made by the same dev who made Raven‚Äôs Quest which has very hot corruption and clothing choices so I was very excited to try their next project. Especially when I saw it was a parody game which I am constantly looking for but never find anything good. In fact, I would confidently say that the vast majority of games that focus on characters from an already established fictional universe are either extremely low quality, blatant cash grabs, or both. I have tried every Naruto or Pokemon game I could find and have been disappointed in them all. The same goes for other games like Luna in the Tavern which has unbelievably poor progression and paywalls for over half the content. Other good ones, like Sex Arcade: The Game were abandoned even though they looked super promising. It just isn‚Äôt easy to find harem/trainer games with a good amount of content and good art. The only one I played and liked recently were Ciri Trainer and Game of Whores, both of which are good but not great IMO.\n\nWelcome to Erosland was a very welcome surprise when I stumbled upon it for that reason. Academy34 is great, but I don‚Äôt know of any other good overwatch parodies. (or parodies of that quality, period.)\n\nThe game has many elements of the classic trainer games from Abakur. Corrupting heroines, having them perform tasks for you, and earning new and sluttier outfits to dress them up in. I can‚Äôt get enough of this type of content.\n\nThe game currently features D.Va, some girls from League of Legends that are sexy but I am unfamiliar with, Mercy, Iono from Pokemon, and one original character that serves as the guide.\n\nThere is a city builder element that goes pretty much unused, but has potential if the dev reworks some things with money, I think. You can choose to send your girls to work in different locations around your sexy theme park, but because the girls are unlocked very far apart and not every girl can work each job, there is definitely less freedom than I would like on this progression.\n\nThe H-scenes are very hot and have a good balance of content. Especially D.Va, the first girl you get in your harem. After her, the pace that the other girls become slutty is a bit too fast for my taste, and I think using Hana as a baseline for how fast these things should go would be a good idea for future additions.\n\nThe dialogue is actually pretty good for a H game. I appreciate some of the character moments and humor throughout. You have the option to disable some content with Iono and I think that was a good call.\n\nI think this game has a ton of potential, the art is good, and I love the clothing options, as well as the different jobs the girls can work. It just needs more content more than anything right now.\n\nI really hope some others pick this game up and give it a try. And I really hope the dev will continue working on it, adding new girls and expanding what is possible in terms of jobs, upgrades, and clothing for the existing girls.\n\nAnd I would love to see named park goers who you could maybe cater to and have the girls develop a relationship with, like more overt prostitution elements.\n\nView full post\nu/WANDERER_GAME\n‚Ä¢\n13 hr. ago\nThe sexiest fairy got impregnated (TopHouse) [AURA: Hentai Cards]\nArt\nu/SunriseTeam\n‚Ä¢\n14 hr. ago\nSome great memories - Sunrise City\nArt\nu/Working-Low-8990\n‚Ä¢\n8 hr. ago\nSandbox that is pretty much just sex?\nRecommend\n\nI want to find a sandbox game (can be 2d or 3d) that is like summertime sage or Confined With Goddesses except you don't really have to work for the scenes\n\nu/Tonkboi\n‚Ä¢\n2 hr. ago\nMy Favorite Games\nDiscussion\n\nHero Party Must Fall\n\nTwisted World\n\nTaffy Tales\n\nGood Girl Gone Bad (did not enjoy Red String)\n\nDemon Deals\n\nInsight of You\n\nDesert Stalker\n\nAnyone agree?

One is where you play the role of a hacker or police officer and go through folders, chats and files on your phone or computer to slowly uncover a story or interesting pictures/videos. And the other type is a game that takes place using only a chat app. Are there any such games and can you recommend any?

Right now, I'm basically pulling a Robert Silverberg. He was an American Sci-Fi author, who was nominated for a ton of Hugo awards, and was beloved as an author and as a sci-fi fan. Before he became famous with his novels though, he penned pulpy, erotica novels to make ends meet. I''m basically wanting to do the same. I have a full-time job but I really enjoy writing as a hobby, and like Silverberg, I think I'm not the worst at writing erotica. I've been sketching plans for a sapphic text-only interactive fiction game. My expertise is writing, not drawing. I might be able to include minimal pixel art, ala the First Corruption of Champions.\n\nI see a lot of games, especially here that use Renpy and Honey Select Models, and for me, I think they look uncanny, and it's difficult for me to invest into them as characters and the story, because of how they look. I wonder, do other folks feel the same way? Is there interest in something very text heavy? I'm working on world-building- the theme is Clockpunk meets Weird-Fiction. I'm excited to start properly, but is there interest? This is of course going to be a hobby, but is there demand at all?\n\nView full post\nu/MdLuffy6969\n‚Ä¢\n3 hr. ago\nNend help to find a game\nHelp\n\nIn this game you live with your mom and two sisters.
