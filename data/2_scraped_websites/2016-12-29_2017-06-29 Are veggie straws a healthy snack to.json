You can find these recipes at lowfatlowcarb.com and they will help you with your weight loss goals!\n\nReply\nreply\nMr_BoZipher\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nIf you are trying to lose weight I highly recommend (from personal experience) not snacking at all. Snacks (no matter how \"healthy\") are extra calories that are keeping you from losing weight-- I'm a snacker, so I know this to be the case after I switched to a different way of eating/ thinking about food. There is a free instructional program (I hate to call it a diet, it is really more of a general philosophy) called \"No-S\" (you can google search it, there's a website that explains things in detail). The basic idea is No Seconds, snacks, sweets (except on certain days). So basically, have your true fill on your first plate at your three meals a day and you'll be fine between those meals. If you feel you need to snack, first start with a full glass of water, then if you decide you are actually hungry always go for fruits or veggies. Good luck!\n\nReply\nreply\nfrenchfrites\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nEverything in moderation, but if you're trying to lose weight, I wouldn't recommend them. They're very high in sodium as well. I'd say choose a different snack =/\n\nReply\nreply\n[deleted]\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nI like them as an alternative to chips. Don't know if they're all that healthier though.\n\nReply\nreply\nAmmoholic\n•\n7 yr. ago\n\nThey're not, slightly lower calorie, but they're mostly potato starch and potato flour, much better options out there.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
