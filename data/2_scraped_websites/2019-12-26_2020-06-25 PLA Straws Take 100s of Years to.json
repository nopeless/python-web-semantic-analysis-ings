It’s a small change with big results.”\n\nEcho Instruments, Technology to Measure & Analyse Plastic Biodegradation (FREE)\n\n \n\nChristopher Johnson, general manager of Rutledge Cab Company, has been using the wheat straws in his restaurant for two months.\n\n“The wheat straws are an environmentally sound and cost-effective alternative and improvement upon the typical plastic or paper straw choice, and they actually hold up in a drink,” Johnson said.\n\nAccording to the Holy City Straw company, their straws are sourced from FDA-certified farms, do not require an industrial composting facility, and reduce the carbon footprint of plant-based compostables (PLA) that require those facilities.\n\nWheat straws also biodegrade naturally in two months, while plastics and bioplastics can take hundreds of years.\n\nThe Holy City Straw Company was founded in 2019. Their straws can be purchased online and our also distributed wholesale.\n\n \n\nREFS\n\nPublished on abcnews4.com\n\nCharleston company selling wheat straws amid city’s single-use plastic ban\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSHARE THIS:\nSHARE\nLIKE THIS:\nEcho Instruments, Technology to Measure & Analyse Plastic Biodegradation (FREE)\n\n \n\nRELATED\nThe 4 Truths of PLA Straws\nSeptember 26, 2019\n\nIn \"PLA\"\n\n100% Biodegradable Pasta Straws to Help the Planet\nNovember 24, 2019\n\nIn \"Tableware & Utensil\"\n\nEdible Rice Bioplastics Straws\nJuly 18, 2019\n\nIn \"Tableware & Utensil\"\n\nTAGS: FREE CONTENT\nPublished by Axel Barrett\n\nFounder & Editor of BioplasticsNews.com\nVIEW ALL POSTS BY AXEL BARRETT\n\nBUY A SUBSCRIPTION\nMICHAEL STEPHEN COLUMN\n\nEmail\n\nJOIN NEWSLETTER\n\nTECH to ANALYSE & MEASURE BIODEGRADATION\nCALENDAR OF ARTICLES\nJanuary 2020\nM\tT\tW\tT\tF\tS\tS\n \t1\t2\t3\t4\t5\n6\t7\t8\t9\t10\t11\t12\n13\t14\t15\t16\t17\t18\t19\n20\t21\t22\t23\t24\t25\t26\n27\t28\t29\t30\t31\t \n« Dec   Feb »\nANALYSE & MEASURE PLASTIC BIODEGRADATION\nFREE CONTENT\nBUY A SUBSCRIPTION\nBEST BIOPLASTIC COMPANIES 2022\nMEASURING POLYMER BIODEGRADATION\nVideo Player\n00:00\n03:32\nINFLATION & SHORTAGE\nFAIRY TALES SERIES\nNEWS PER COUNTRY\nBIOPLASTIC FEEDSTOCKS\nBIOPLASTICS APPLICATIONS\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\nTwitter\n \nLinkedIn\n \nYouTube\n \nFacebook\nTECHNOLOGY TO MEASURE BIODEGRADATION\nCIRCULAR PLASTICS\nVideo Player\n00:00\n03:27\n\nEmail\n\nJOIN NEWSLETTER\n\nCOMPOSTABLE PLASTICS – ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES\nVideo Player\n00:00\n03:56\nBIOPLASTICS HISTORY\nUNIVERSITIES, INSTITUTES, R&D CENTRES\nBUY A SUBSCRIPTION\nCHANGE EMAIL FREQUENCY\nVIRUS vs BACTERIA vs MICROBES\nTECH to ANALYSE & MEASURE BIODEGRADATION\nFREE ARTICLES\nBIOPLASTIC FEEDSTOCK\n\n“The whole art of government consists in the art of being honest” – Thomas Jefferson \n\n“Honesty is the 1st chapter in the book of wisdom” – Thomas Jefferson\n\nCIRCULAR ECONOMY\nUNIVERSITIES, INSTITUTES, R&D CENTRES\nSEARCH THIS WEBSITE\nSearch for:\nSEARCH\nSort by \nRelevance\nNewest first\nOldest first\nNEWS PER TYPE OF BIOPLASTICS\nEU AFFAIRS\nRECYCLING – ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES\nVideo Player\n00:00\n01:31\nREAD FREE CONTENT\nCHEMICAL RECYCLING – ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES\nVideo Player\n00:00\n01:25\nPLA – ADVANTAGES & DISADVANTAGES\nVideo Player\n00:00\n05:39\nBIOBASED PLASTICS\nVideo Player\n00:00\n02:14\nBIOPLASTICS IN COSMETICS\nTEXTILE, SHOES & SPORTS\nLIGNIN\nJOIN US ON LINKEDIN!\n\nEmail Address\n\nJOIN NEWSLETTER\n\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER\nBIOPLASTICS NEWS IN JAPAN\nFREE CONTENT\nBIOPLASTICS COMPANIES\nJOINT VENTURES & PARTNERSHIPS\nBIOPLASTICS NEWS PER COUNTRY\nBIOPLASTICS TOYS\nRETAIL\nPACKAGING\nBIOPLASTICS BRANDS\nBIOPLASTICS BAGS\nAWARDS\n\nEmail\n\nJOIN NEWSLETTER\n\nASSOCIATIONS & FEDERATIONS\nPost navigation\nPREVIOUS ENTRY\nASDA Goes for Refill Stations\nNEXT ENTRY\nIndians Invent Bioplastics that is Cheaper and Stronger than PLA\n\nBIOPLASTICS NEWS\n\n \n\nYour Independent News Source on Bioplastics\n\nTwitter\nLinkedIn\nFacebook\nYoutube\nBioplastics\nBioplastics Producers\nBioplastics Companies\nBioplastics Brands\nBioplastic Feedstocks\nBioplastics Applications\nAssociations and Federations\nEvents & Conferences\nBioplastics Awards\nEvents 2020\nEvents 2019\nConference Notes\nPast Bioplastics Events\nChemicals & Materials\nPLA\nPHA\nPEF\nFDCA\nDrop-Ins\nPBS\nPBT\nBio-BDO\nFurfural\nBioplastic News\nPLA News\nPHA News\nPEF News\nPBAT News\nFDCA News\nBio-PE News\nBio-PP News\nBio-PA News\nBio-PU News\nBio-PET News\nSelect Language\nAfrikaans\nAlbanian\nAmharic\nArabic\nArmenian\nAssamese\nAymara\nAzerbaijani\nBambara\nBasque\nBelarusian\nBengali\nBhojpuri\nBosnian\nBulgarian\nCatalan\nCebuano\nChichewa\nChinese (Simplified)\nChinese (Traditional)\nCorsican\nCroatian\nCzech\nDanish\nDhivehi\nDogri\nDutch\nEsperanto\nEstonian\nEwe\nFilipino\nFinnish\nFrench\nFrisian\nGalician\nGeorgian\nGerman\nGreek\nGuarani\nGujarati\nHaitian Creole\nHausa\nHawaiian\nHebrew\nHindi\nHmong\nHungarian\nIcelandic\nIgbo\nIlocano\nIndonesian\nIrish\nItalian\nJapanese\nJavanese\nKannada\nKazakh\nKhmer\nKinyarwanda\nKonkani\nKorean\nKrio\nKurdish (Kurmanji)\nKurdish (Sorani)\nKyrgyz\nLao\nLatin\nLatvian\nLingala\nLithuanian\nLuganda\nLuxembourgish\nMacedonian\nMaithili\nMalagasy\nMalay\nMalayalam\nMaltese\nMaori\nMarathi\nMeiteilon (Manipuri)\nMizo\nMongolian\nMyanmar (Burmese)\nNepali\nNorwegian\nOdia (Oriya)\nOromo\nPashto\nPersian\nPolish\nPortuguese\nPunjabi\nQuechua\nRomanian\nRussian\nSamoan\nSanskrit\nScots Gaelic\nSepedi\nSerbian\nSesotho\nShona\nSindhi\nSinhala\nSlovak\nSlovenian\nSomali\nSpanish\nSundanese\nSwahili\nSwedish\nTajik\nTamil\nTatar\nTelugu\nThai\nTigrinya\nTsonga\nTurkish\nTurkmen\nTwi\nUkrainian\nUrdu\nUyghur\nUzbek\nVietnamese\nWelsh\nXhosa\nYiddish\nYoruba\nZulu\nPowered by Translate\nTERMS OF SERVICE\n \nCOOKIE POLICY\n \nPRIVACY POLICY\n \nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nPrivacy & Cookies: This site uses cookies.
