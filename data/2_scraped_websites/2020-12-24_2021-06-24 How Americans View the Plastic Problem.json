Plastic waste has invaded our homes; it has been found in the deepest parts of the ocean, piling up in landfills and leaking into nature since the 1950s. The public is increasingly frustrated with how pervasive and unavoidable single use plastics truly is today. Consumers are aware that plastic pollution is a major problem facing our environment but are often unable to reduce their reliance on waste. The time to end plastic waste is now.\n\nIn fact, a recent study commissioned by World Wildlife Fund found that 86% of Americans agree we need to transition from an economy that throws things away to one that emphasizes reuse and recycling. This broad agreement across political affiliations and geographies showcases the need for not only reforming our waste management system, but for a reevaluation of the ways plastic is produced.\n\nThe plastic waste problem is complex, but the public demands are clear: 68% of the public believes that companies that produce plastic need to help pay for the recycling system.\n\nBut how do consumers, governments and, most importantly, producers, come together to fix the problem when our recycling system does not deliver the results we want to see? Surprisingly, a solution already exists, and it is known as Extended Producer Responsibility.\n\nExtended Producer Responsibility can bring together public demands, government oversight and corporate accountability through a new, equitable system.\n\nWorld Wildlife Fund has been working with all stakeholders—governments, activists and corporations—to make EPR a reality and to end plastic leakage into nature.\n\nOur new public opinion research has more key findings:\n\n71% of the public believes that the United States needs to reduce our reliance on plastic.\n81% of the public wants to recycle more of their plastic waste, but 77% agree that so many things are made of plastic packaging without any way to avoid it.\n14% of respondents, or about 1 in 7 households, indicated that they had no access to any recycling services, and 33% of respondents rely on a public recycling drop-off center.\nOut of a suite of proposed regulatory systems, deposit return systems, reusable bag credits, recycled content mandates, and single-use phase outs all received positive public support.\n72% of Americans are very frustrated with the fact that plastic waste from the United States often ends up in the ocean.\n\nYou can read more in a new report commissioned by WWF: “Public Opinion Surrounding Plastic Consumption and Waste Management of Consumer Packaging.”\n\nSUBSCRIBE\nTO RSS FEEDS\nFOLLOW US\nON TWITTER\nSearch the Sustainability Works blog\nSearch\nTOPICS\nSustainable Business\nWWF Markets Institute\nFood and Agriculture\nPlastic\nClimate\nForests\nGrasslands\nFreshwater\nOceans\nWildlife\nPROFILES\nSustainability in Local Government\nBehind the Scenes with WWF Staff\nRising Stars in Sustainability\nWomen in Sustainability\nRESOURCES\nChanging the Nature of Business\nWWF Markets Institute\nBetter business for a better Earth\nReSource: Plastic\nForests Forward\nFood Waste\nJason Clay TED Talk: How Big Brands Can Help Save Biodiversity\nContact the editors\nARCHIVE\nShow All\nShow All\nDecember 2023\nNovember 2023\nOctober 2023\nSeptember 2023\nAugust 2023\nJuly 2023\nJune 2023\nMay 2023\nApril 2023\nMarch 2023\nFebruary 2023\nJanuary 2023\nDecember 2022\nNovember 2022\nOctober 2022\nSeptember 2022\nAugust 2022\nJuly 2022\nJune 2022\nMay 2022\nApril 2022\nMarch 2022\nFebruary 2022\nJanuary 2022\nDecember 2021\nNovember 2021\nOctober 2021\nSeptember 2021\nAugust 2021\nJuly 2021\nJune 2021\nMay 2021\nApril 2021\nMarch 2021\nFebruary 2021\nJanuary 2021\nDecember 2020\nNovember 2020\nOctober 2020\nSeptember 2020\nAugust 2020\nJuly 2020\nJune 2020\nMay 2020\nApril 2020\nMarch 2020\nFebruary 2020\nJanuary 2020\nDecember 2019\nNovember 2019\nOctober 2019\nSeptember 2019\nAugust 2019\nJuly 2019\nJune 2019\nMay 2019\nMarch 2019\nFebruary 2019\nJanuary 2019\nDecember 2018\nNovember 2018\nOctober 2018\nSeptember 2018\nAugust 2018\nJune 2018\nMay 2018\nApril 2018\nMarch 2018\nFebruary 2018\nJanuary 2018\nDecember 2017\nNovember 2017\nOctober 2017\nSeptember 2017\nAugust 2017\nJuly 2017\nJune 2017\nMay 2017\nApril 2017\nMarch 2017\nFebruary 2017\nJanuary 2017\nDecember 2016\nNovember 2016\nOctober 2016\nSeptember 2016\nAugust 2016\nJuly 2016\nJune 2016\nMay 2016\nApril 2016\nMarch 2016\nFebruary 2016\nJanuary 2016\nDecember 2015\nNovember 2015\nOctober 2015\nSeptember 2015\nAugust 2015\nJuly 2015\nJune 2015\nMay 2015\nApril 2015\nMarch 2015\nFebruary 2015\nDecember 2014\nNovember 2014\nOctober 2014\nSeptember 2014\nJuly 2014\nJune 2014\nMay 2014\nApril 2014\nMarch 2014\nFebruary 2014\nJanuary 2014\nDecember 2013\nNovember 2013\nOctober 2013\nSeptember 2013\nAugust 2013\nJuly 2013\nJune 2013\nMay 2013\nApril 2013\nMarch 2013\nLOG IN\nDISCOVER\nWho we are\nFinancials\nLatest stories\nOur work\nNewsroom\nEn español\nTravel\nSUPPORT\nDonate now\nAdopt an animal\nGive in someone's name\nGift and estate planning\nCONNECT\nTake action\nGet involved\nCareers\nContact\nHelp center\nWWF country offices\nEthics reporting\nGET THE LATEST CONSERVATION NEWS\nFirst Name (required)\nLast Name (required)\nEmail Address (required)\nZip Code (required)\nBe a part of our community\n\nWe’ll send you conservation news and updates on how you can protect nature through activism, donating, events, and more.
