Shoppers note that after about three3 months of heavy use, it might be time to replace your straw. Luckily for you, this set comes with multiple straws and a cleaning brush and is packaged up in a cotton pouch.\n\nPrice at time of publish: $9.95\n\nStraw Material: Bamboo | Carrying Case: Cotton pouch | Length: 6 straws are 5 inches long, 6 are 9 inches long\n\nBest MetalOXO Good Grips 5-Piece Set Reusable Straws\n\nAMAZON\n\nView On Amazon\nView On Oxo\nWho It’s Good For\n\nAnyone looking for the durability of a metal straw with the comfortable mouth-feel of a silicone one\n\nWho It’s Not Good For\n\nSome shoppers note that the silicone tips wear away over time\n\nThough most metal straws are similar in form and function, the OXO Good Grips straws provide something that most others don’t: a soft silicone tip that makes sipping more enjoyable. That fine attention to detail sets OXO apart from the pack, along with its durable 18/8 stainless steel material and BPA-free components. This set includes two eight-inch straws, two 10.5-inch straws, and a cleaning brush. \n\nPrice at time of publish: $13.95\n\nStraw Material: Stainless steel | Carrying Case: None | Length: Two eight-inch, two 10.5-inch\n\nHow to Pick the Right Reusable Straws\nPrice\n\nNowadays, reusable straws are available in all different kinds of materials — glass, bamboo, metal, silicon, and more. When picking out your reusable straw, think about what kinds of beverages you’ll likely be using them for. Glass straws, like the Hay Sip Cocktail Straws, commonly work for both hot and cold beverages, while metal straws are not always graded for hot liquids. Some materials, like bamboo, tend to wear down faster and need replacing more often than sturdier materials, like glass and stainless steel.\n\nLength\n\nDepending on how high your drinking container is, you might prefer your straw to be longer or shorter. For example, short drinking glasses might be more difficult to sip from with a very long straw, and a straw that’s shorter than the height of a tall drinking glass isn’t useful. We like the Anpro Portable Collapsible Straw for its ability to transform into a shorter or longer straw to suit your needs.\n\n The 8 Best Insulated Water Bottles of 2023 to Keep You Cool and Hydrated\nFrequently Asked Questions\nCan I use a reusable straw for hot beverages?\n\nThis is entirely dependent on the material. It’s important to check on the manufacturer's website before attempting to use a straw in very hot or very cold liquids.\n\nHow long will my straw last?\n\nThis is also entirely dependent on the material your straw is made from. More durable materials like metal and glass can last for years, while straws made from bamboo (like the Bambaw Reusable Bamboo Straws) might wear down faster but are biodegradable which is another environmental plus.\n\nIs it better to use a reusable straw than a single-use plastic one?\n\nOpting for a reusable straw over a disposable, single-use one can help protect wildlife, says Matt Prindiville, the CEO of pollution-reducing nonprofit Upstream. According to Prindiville, many of the disposable plastic straws we toss away “wind up in the environment where they can harm wildlife, and even break into microplastics, which absorb toxic chemicals and get into the food chain — and eventually into us.”\n\n\nTake Our Word For It\n\nCai Cramer is a commerce writer at PEOPLE, covering the best and buzziest products across the beauty, fashion, health, and lifestyle spaces.
