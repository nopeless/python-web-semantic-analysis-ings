I cleaned and vacuumed the inside of my car but couldn't find it, it's under the seats somewhere.\n\nOn the slight chance that a police officer searches my vehicle and finds it, would a microscopic amount of cocaine residue be enough to get someone in trouble?\n\nArchived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast.\nSort by:\nA_Criminal_Lawyer\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nIn Florida, possession of cocaine, in any amount, is a felony. The straw itself can also be considered paraphernalia which is a misdemeanor. Typical clients with those charges don't walk away without at least a few months of jail time. I suggest quitting the habit since it eventually catches up to you in the form of handcuffs and a jail cell. If you have an addiction, please seek rehab.\n\n-AJ\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nYes\n\nlitmustest1\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nFind that straw and get rid of it. If discovered by an officer, you could definitely face charges for possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\nhortonhoo\n•\n8 yr. ago\nmbz321\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nLOL\n\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/NoahGetTheBoat\nMother and daughter carjacked at gunpoint in Chicago\nyoutube\n181 upvotes · 14 comments\nr/geek\nBit bending an MRI to play Bach\nyoutube\n138 upvotes · 16 comments\nr/Documentaries\nThe Forever Chemical Scandal (2023) PFAS chemicals are used in thousands of products aimed at making life easier.
