A huge portion of these meals are takeaway or on-the-go and - you guessed it - are served in disposable plastic food containers. Usually paired with a drink - bubble tea, papaya juice, whatever - in plastic cup with plastic straw. In a plastic bag, of course.\n\nTaiwan has a traditionally powerful plastics industry dating back to the 1960s. Lobbying is common, a la the US system.\n\nMoving to ban all single-use plastics outright, even in a distant 10 years, is actually quite a bold and ambitious move by the current government.\n\nAlso... Tai-Ban.\n\ncybervseas\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nIn India street food dishes are often served in premade bowls of leaves, which are surprisingly sturdy.\n\n33 more replies\nSiberianBear\n•\n6 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 6 yr. ago\n\nWhat is the \"Tai-Ban\" referring to?\n\n13 more replies\n44 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nIt seems more and more countries are starting to STOP the 'single use' plastic to save the planet! Good, do it and let the word spread far and wide.\n\nNapkin_whore\n•\n6 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 6 yr. ago\n\nTaiwan has been doing it right for a long fucking time. I remember buying shampoo there: the first time you buy, you purchase a slightly more expensive plastic jug with a pump on top. After that, they have refillable bags to put more shampoo into the jug at a cheaper price (because your not paying for the pump).\n\nThey have so many trash cans that I was embarrassingly confused trying to throw away my lunch.\n\nOh and they have some of the dopest night clubs.\n\nSo fucking safe.\n\nI passed out in a park one time and woke up to the aunties doing their Taichi at like 6am. Didn't leave the club until daybreak, so wasn't in the park for long before they came.\n\nEdit: Getting lots of salt from other people who must have had a bad time in their travels. People pass out all over the place, and even in the clubs. Everyone let's them be. When in Rome. I didn't bother anyone, respectful as fuck all the time. If people talked about me in the native tongue, I didn't say anything, met many friends, and even ended up meeting families and enjoying their company.\n\nEdit: Alot of people have said that this may not be as environmentally friendly as I initially thought. I don't know enough about materials in products to answer. I thought that because it was a thin bag without a pump, it was saving resources, and I only needed to buy a containing jug one time. Other posters have pointed this out with their larger body of knowledge. Thank you for that.\n\n98 more replies\n201 more replies\nfflando\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nI want bubble tea now\n\n20 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n6 yr. ago\nYouNeedToGo\n•\n6 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 6 yr. ago\n\nI don’t understand why these policies take 15 years to implement\n\nbadamache\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nNot sure about Taiwan, but in any country with a fast food culture, straws are essential. How does one consume a McDonalds shake without a straw? In East Asia, disposable chopsticks are part of every meal. Due to crowded cities, these places are germaphobic (notice the photos with Asians wearing surgical masks?) - it takes a long time to convince customers that utensils are sterile - especially with the scandals over tainted milk and cooking oil.\n\n233 more replies\nTonkarz\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nLet's say yesterday you just took out a loan to by a house. Let's say the business you own and run makes and sells these forks. How are you going to pay for this loan now that overnight your business was ruled illegal? What about the 200 people that work for you? What about all your competitors? What about the businesses that rely on you to do their business? And what about the businesses that rely on those businesses?\n\n9 more replies\n68 more replies\nsammyo\n•\n6 yr. ago\n\nHow do you effectively clean straws at volume?
