Corporate waste and commercial fishing makes up for 95% of the trash in the ocean. Plastic straws .002%. Paper straws are terrible to use and there are new studies showing that they are actually harmful.\n\nUse a plastic straw that doesn’t fucking crumble in 5 minutes. Silicone straws are fine, metal straws are fine. But if you are a crusader for paper straws I probably think you’re an idiot and fall for corporate propaganda so easily\n\nTLDR: paper straws are ass, and you’re not a bad person for using plastic, despite what uninformed activists say\n\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nAutoModerator\n•\n4 mo. ago\nModerator Announcement Read More »\nReply\nreply\nmellow_squid\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nThey decompose and plastic doesn't 🤷‍♀️\n\nReply\nreply\n5 more replies\nWorking_Horse_3077\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nMetal straw. Durable washable and reusable. Just because it's insignificant in the whole scheme of things doesn't mean it isn't a significant improvement. Getting rid of plastic straws would be a whopping 8.3 billion less objects that don't decompose per year.\n\nReply\nreply\nFlyParticular8172\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nSo do like plastic or paper because I sell both. I'll agree with whatever point you make as long as you buy my straws. What environment?\n\nReply\nreply\nOk_Force_2190\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nFuck it, uranium straws. Why not?\n\nReply\nreply\nMDMagicMark\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nHell yeah\n\nReply\nreply\nChaotic_Boots\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nI don't even know why we bother recycling paper. It is worse for the environment to recycle paper than it is to just let it decompose. The logging industry plants a shit load of trees to make sure they don't have a \"lorax\" situation where they run out of product to sell.\n\nPlastic is a wonder material that can do basically anything but it's terrible as far as a waste product, takes forever to decompose and gets into everything.\n\nBut plastic straws are a negligible part of plastic use in the world. There are so many better options to reduce plastic use.\n\nReply\nreply\nTheUnhollyGoblin\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\nI don't think we should have any straws because I'm actually able to put my lips to the cup like an adult\n\nReply\nreply\ndoc_shades\n•\n4 mo. ago\n\naren't paper straws compostable? they will break down and \"fucking crumble\", unlike a plastic straw which will be a plastic straw for hundreds? thousands? or years.\n\nReply\nreply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/Millennials\nMid-late millennials rejoice!
