Too much air, makes me burp.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nI mix the drink with it and hold it to the side while I sip. Rarely I get a drink that isn't mixed but sometimes the bartender pours the booze on last and its worth it to avoid the unexpected taste.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nNo, I use it to drink my drink.\n\nzimmer199\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nMen's drinks don't come with straws.\n\nIn all seriousness, I don't often order mixed drinks or cocktails, but when I do I leave the straw in and hold it back with my finger as I sip from the glass.\n\n6 more replies\nKastoli\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nDepends highly upon the glass and the drink.\n\nI'll always take the straw out of a margarita glass, or a martini glass, Rarely ever take it out of a high ball glass, but I always take it out of my rum'n'coke.\n\nlike_a_yoyo\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nReposted to r/AskToddlers\n\nkellykebab\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nYup, pretty much always\n\nkimchifreeze\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nNowadays, if it's not water, I'd rather drink it with a straw. It's easier on the teeth and I still taste it all the same. Also, it's cleaner too since I don't get anything on my upper lip.\n\nValkes\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nNo, but I don't always use the straw. If the drink comes with ice then I'll use it but if it doesn't I'll only use the straw after a certain level.\n\ngimpisgawd\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nAlcoholic drink yeah, out at a restaurant and it's a normal drink then no.\n\nnaked_avenger\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nYes. Drinking it straight makes my lips chapped.\n\n1991_VG\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nYes.\n\nMaleCra\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nIf it's sugary, I leave it in. Really don't like the feeling of sugary drinks caked on my teeth.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nYes or I do the bend. No sissy sticks here\n\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nI take it out when I give it to the server/waitress. Otherwise that'd be kinda gross for them.\n\n[deleted]\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\ni don't always because i usually order drinks at bars where they might not have necessarily cleaned their glasses as thoroughly as i'd like. most places just gives them a rinse and dont use soap since the need to wash such a high volume of glasses constantly. the star insures you aren't putting your lips somewhere you wouldn't want to\n\n99slobra\n•\n9 yr. ago\n\nAlcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks yes. Just don't like them.\n\nView more comments\n \nr/AskMen\nNSFW\nWhat’s something a girl did in bed that changed your brain chemistry?\n3.1K upvotes · 1.7K comments\nr/AskMen\nWhat's causing men to become more discouraged?\n1.8K upvotes · 2.8K comments\nr/AskMen\nWhy is it still accepted that men have to pay for dates?\n1.4K upvotes · 1.7K comments\nr/AskMen\nNSFW\nWhat feels most intimate with a partner?\n1.3K upvotes · 557 comments\nr/AskMen\nNSFW\nWhat is something you would do if you knew you could get away with it with zero consequences?\n971 upvotes · 759 comments\nr/AskMen\nWhat’s the most impressionable thing a girl ever did on a first date that made you can’t stop thinking about her?\n760 upvotes · 323 comments\nr/AskMen\nMen in relationships with other men, if there's a noise at night, how is it determined who checks it out?\n757 upvotes · 199 comments\nr/AskMen\nWhat are some of the most profound things women have told you?\n739 upvotes · 337 comments\nr/AskMen\nWhy am I attracted to trashy girls?\n729 upvotes · 365 comments\nr/AskMen\nFleabag, is a show that, for me, encapsulates/ expresses the experience of being a woman better than any show ever written.
