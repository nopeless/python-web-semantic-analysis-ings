Is it worse? Better? About the same? If it is bad, about how often should I be dusting to avoid choked airflow / decreased hardware longevity?\n\nThe brand of incense I use is Satya and I burn 2-3 sticks/day, if that's relevant.\n\nThanks all for your time!\n\nArchived post.

Yes. That grungy dusty kinda greasy grey gunk inside your computer when you clean it? Mostly skin cells, bits of hair, dust mites that live off that, and random stuff you brought into the house such as dirt, sand, and outdoor pollution. So 25 percent bits of you, and 75 percent stuff that you are unavoidably going to add just by being around.\n\nBurning incense every now and then likely is not going to contribute much to that muck. Of course if you are burning incense every hour of the day, I retract my assessment.\n\n1 more reply\n \nTop 1%\nRank by size \nr/mac\nThe impact of 8gb vs 16gb measured\nyoutube\n323 upvotes · 311 comments\nr/kurzgesagt\nTHE LAST THING THAT WILL EVER HAPPEN\nyoutube\n132 upvotes · 35 comments\nr/geek\nBit bending an MRI to play Bach\nyoutube\n139 upvotes · 16 comments\nPROMOTED\nr/Piracy\nSony Steals Customers' Purchased Content - Piracy is COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED | Louis Rossmann Youtube\nyoutube\n498 upvotes · 123 comments\nr/Python\nWhat the Heck Are Monads?!\nyoutube\n131 upvotes · 53 comments\nr/SmarterEveryDay\nI Was SCARED To Say This To NASA...
