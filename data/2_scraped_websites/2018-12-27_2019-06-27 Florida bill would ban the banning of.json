And no, just because someone disagrees with the premise of banning plastic straws because they feel it would hurt disabled people's ability to consume drinks doesn't mean they think businesses should provide everything a disabled person needs to feel comfortable.

If a local government is doing something that the state doesn't like, the next legislative session they pass a bill to ban whatever it was that local government did. Sometimes it'll have a grandfather clause in it that allows one or two instances to pass (see: HB631 last year, the public access beach bill) but sometimes the retroactive start date is before the local government passed their ordinance (also see HB631, which targeted Walton County specifically).\n\nLong story short: God forbid a local government does something that the state legislature doesn't like, because they WILL take action on that instead of a number of actual issues at the state level. Sometimes it almost makes sense, and then other times it's something batshit crazy like banning a ban on plastic straws.\n\nsriracharade\n‚Ä¢\n5 yr. ago\n\nThere's the ignorant Republicans that we know and hate.
