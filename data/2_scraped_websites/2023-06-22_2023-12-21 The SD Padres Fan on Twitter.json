He got upset when there weren’t any plastic straws out at the condiment station, witness Brenda Biandudi told CNN.\n\nHe walked back to the counter and got in a heated argument with an employee about the straws, Biandudi said. Then, video shows him reaching over the counter and grabbing the employee, Yasmine James.\n\nBy the end of the night, Daniel Taylor, a 40-year-old homeless man, would be arrested on two charges of simple battery, according to an arrest affidavit from the St. Petersburg Police Department. A lawyer for Taylor could not be reached Wednesday night.\n\nA city ordinance went into effect on January 1 that requires customers to ask for straws. It’s a way for businesses to adjust before a ban on single-use plastic straws takes effect in January 2020.\n\nTaylor said the employees weren’t doing their jobs. “She told him we’re not allowed to have (straws) in the lobby but he can get one upon request. He said there was no such law. He started exchanging words laced with profanity, which I won’t repeat,” Biandudi, 62, said.\n\n“I looked at my camera and I thought I may need to record this since there were so few people in the store. As soon as he approached her, I hit record. He reached across and tried to grab her and hit her,” she said.\n\nJames and her attorney, Michele Rayner-Goolsby, spoke out about the attack on HLN on Friday.\n\n“I didn’t know if he had a gun, a knife or what was he going to do to me. I felt very alone because no one helped me or anything,” James told HLN on Friday. “I was very overwhelmed and stressed because a man just grabbed me and tried to attack me.”\n\n“He was upset about the straw, but I don’t think that the conversation that we had was enough to lead up for him to grab me,” she said.\n\nRayner-Goolsby said James was “lucky” she wasn’t hurt in the attack, but said more needs to be done to protect employees from these situations.\n\n“She never should have been in this position in the first place,” Rayner-Goolsby said. “One of the things that she is very passionate about as a result of this is ensuring that violence against women and violence against workers stops. For her, this is the last straw.”\n\nFull Article: https://cnn.com/2019/01/02/us/customer-attacks-mcdonalds-employee/index.html…\n12:46 PM · Jul 14, 2023\n·\n56.9K\n Views\n5\n Reposts\n2\n Quotes\n183\n Likes\n10\n Bookmarks\n10\nNew to X?\nSign up now to get your own personalized timeline!\nSign up with Apple\nCreate account\nBy signing up, you agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, including Cookie Use.\nRelevant people\n🅸🆃 🅵 🅲🅽🆃🅴🆇🆃\n@TheSDPadresFan\nFollow\nTrends are unavailable.\nTerms of Service\nPrivacy Policy\nCookie Policy\nAccessibility\nAds info\nMore\n© 2023 X Corp."
