It’s used for everything from food packaging to the casing of electronics and even as a substitute for glassware. However, it can also be found in more mundane items like straws. Are plastic straws recyclable?

Plastic straws can’t be made into new products and often end up in landfills or oceans.\n\nThere is an alternative to using plastic straws: you can buy reusable stainless steel or glass straws instead of disposable paper cups with lids that have a slot for a drinking straw.\n\nSome people use reusable bamboo or metal straws as well. The best thing about this option is that it’s convenient- drop your used one in the dishwasher! Some restaurants also offer biodegradable, compostable iced teaspoons at no charge if you ask nicely enough for them when ordering food from their counter service window counters. Why would anyone want to use plastic straws then? Plastic straws are cheap, but they’re not environmentally friendly.\n\nNow Playing\nCan You Recycle Garbage Bags?\nCan You Recycle Fiberglass?\n2:39\nCan You Recycle Juice Boxes?\n2:43\nCan You Recycle Toothpaste Tubes?

Plastic straws are not always recyclable in every location because there is no standardized recycling process yet.\n\nIf your city or town accepts plastics at their facility, they might also recycle plastic straws. The type of plastics that the city/town accepts will vary by municipality, so it’s important to determine if this applies to yours beforehand. For example, some cities accept styrofoam, and others don’t – but both can sometimes be recycled through curbside pickup programs where residents take a certain amount of materials each month (like glass). Plastic grocery bags cannot be accepted in most municipalities across Canada.\n\nIf you’re recycling plastic straws, your best bet is to reach out to a facility in your area that recycles plastics. You can find this information on the web or by calling before you head out. Some store chains offer opportunities for customers to recycle their packaging and leftover food products (like Starbucks).\n\nRead also: 10 of the Best Brands of Plastic-Free Eco Friendly Lunch Bags\nMake your label cords from a plastic straw.\n\nLabels on cords can be created from pieces of plastic straws. Plastic-like material is cut into small strips and then wrapped around the cord to make a high visibility label and will not take up space in landfills after use. Plastic straws can also be used to create a label that is not plastic-like but has the same identification function.\n\nLabels on cords are an easy way to ensure people do not accidentally plug in their cell phone chargers into live outlets or other dangerous electric locations without knowing it. Plastic straws provide transparency and are recyclable as well for less waste.\n\nWash your plastic straws for reuse.\n\nWash the plastic straws thoroughly with dish soap and water to remove any remaining food residue, then let it dry completely before reusing it. Plastic straws can be reused multiple times if you clean them properly each time.\n\nPlace a container within your kitchen or office that will hold the used high-quality plastic straws until they are collected for recycling (either by yourself or someone else). Make sure this is an airtight container, so no liquid leaks into other recyclables in the bin.\n\nMake a mock bouquet with straws and zip ties.\nYou can use straws to make a bouquet out of zip ties. Plastic insulation tubes or even old CDs work well for this project as well.\nCut the top off a plastic water bottle and insert the bottom end into the neck of another slightly smaller one from which you’ve cut away about an inch in length all along its circumference and at right angles so that it looks like they’re stacked on top of each other with their openings facing inward.\nFill both bottles halfway up with colored liquid (or leave them empty), then push a small stick down through their tops until it’s level with the surface inside both bottles; you’ll need to poke some holes first if your material is too thick.\nNow insert some straws into the neck of each bottle, cut from one end to about two inches past its top.\nPut a zip tie around the part where they meet and tighten it, so the stick is held upright in both bottles, connecting them at their openings. You can also add ribbons if you like for that extra touch.\nRead also: Are Plastic Hangers Recyclable? And How To Recycle Them?\nCollect the straws\n\nYou can collect the straws in the plastic container when you use them. If they are not in a single container, like those with holes or loops that can be hooked together to form a chain for transport, then it is best to wrap them in paper before putting them in any non-recyclable receptacle. Plastic straws should never go into recycling bins because their small size and shape make them difficult to catch by sorting machines called optical sorters (or Optical Sorting Systems).\n\nDecorate vase or candleholder\n\nFor decorating the outside of a vase or candleholder for a colorful centerpiece, you can use straws in various colors to create patterns. You might want to try spirals, dots, stripes, and other shapes as well.\n\nFor the inside of your dishware- why not fill it with brightly colored marbles? Plastic drinking bottles work great too! For smaller dishes such as small bowls or glasses, decorate them with pieces of fruit that have been cut into different shapes from vegetables like carrots or zucchini using cookie cutters.\n\nFill up ice cube trays with water dyed bright shades of blue, green, or pink, then place clear plastic lids on top so they don’t evaporate when frozen. When frozen solid, remove them carefully by sliding a butter knife along the edges of the container and pop out your ice cubes, or fill them with juice for a fun summer drink.\n\nRead also: Top Plastic Reusable Plates Available On Amazon\nTake drinks without a straw.\n\nOne of the best ways you can help the planet is to enjoy drinks without a straw. Plastic straws have become one of the most common types of trash polluting our oceans and waterways, so you must make an effort to reduce your reliance on them.\n\nDo not use plastic straws when purchasing or consuming food items.\n\nA little bit more proactive than just avoiding drinking with a straw, consider never ordering any drink with a cocktail stirrer either. If you are buying takeout for dinner at home rather than getting it delivered, do not order hot beverages like coffee or tea with lids made out of styrofoam cups because they will come preloaded with plenty of single-use plastic utensils in their packaging as well.\n\nRead also: A Practical Guide To Plastic Bag Recycling\nChoose reusable straws\n\nIf you’re an avid user of plastic straws and have trouble not giving in to the temptation, there are plenty of eco-friendly options that will both help your conscience as well as the earth. Plastic straw alternatives come made from bamboo, glass, paper, or stainless steel so ensure that when ordering a drink at a restaurant, for example, ask the waiter for one made out of either metal or wood instead. You can also purchase environmentally friendly insulated tumblers, which are great for keeping drinks cold without adding additional waste like single-use plastics. They don’t require lids or sipping cups with their packaging just to keep hands-free drinking time.\n\nBuy reusable straws to reduce the use of a plastic straw.\n\nIf you are a person who would love to help the environment, you can start by buying reusable straws. Plastic straws are not recyclable, so it is best to avoid them as much as possible. Reusable plastic straws can be bought at most grocery stores or even on Amazon. Plastic straws are very cheap to buy, so investing in reusable plastic straws is a great way to reduce the use of disposable plastics that may have been previously thrown away without being recycled.\n\nAsk restaurants not to give you a straw automatically\n\nYou have noticed that most restaurants automatically give you a plastic straw with your drink order. This may be because it is one of the easiest things for the wait staff to do. Plastic straws are not recyclable, and when they end up in the ocean, many animals mistake them for food because of their size.\n\nIf you notice that your waiter is about to give you a plastic straw with your drink order automatically, it’s time to speak up. Ask them if there would be any possible way for you not to get one or have the option of getting a paper straw instead.\n\nTalk to the community about limiting their straw use.\n\nYou should discuss among your community people about limiting their straw use. Plastic pollution is only increasing, and this will be the best way to reduce future plastic waste on our planet. To save our planet from plastic pollution, we should limit the use of straws. Plastic is not recyclable and can’t be decomposed naturally without expensive technology that isn’t available worldwide.\n\nUse biodegradable paper straws\n\nPaper-made straws are biodegradable. Biodegradable straws are made of non-toxic materials. Plastic straws take a long time to decompose and will not break down in landfills, water systems, or composters. Plastic is toxic when used for food service ware since it leeches toxins into the liquid that then tastes with plastic flavor.\n\nPaper straws can be found online, such as EcoStraw. They come in many colors, but they’re most commonly white because they don’t have any ink on them, which means you’re protecting their environment if you choose this type of paper drinking paraphernalia over plastic ones! One hundred percent biodegradable paper products like these dissolve easily and do not contain harmful chemicals like those found in plastic straws.\n\nFinal thought\n\nWe know straws are a small item. But they can add up to be hundreds of thousands, if not millions, over time! And while recycling is important for the environment, it may be better for your wallet in the long run too. Follow these ways, and you’ll have less plastic waste clogging up landfills or taking away valuable resources from other recyclable items that need them far more than some old plastic straws do. So go ahead and drink up without worrying about what will happen next!\n\nTagged plastic, recycling\nSam\nHi, I'm Sam, a digital marketer, a blogger and I have a Ph. D. degree in plant Biology.
