Especially members of the disabled community.\n\nThe reusable ones can require too much dexterity and precise arm control to clean after each use.\n\nThe biodegradable ones can break down way too often when you have to use a straw with every sip because you’re literally incapable of lifting up your glass. So using a paper straw all day every day creates a ton more waste, cost, and transportation/manufacturing emissions because you may end up needing a new straw every 30 minutes the entire day.\n\nThat’s why rather than an actual ban on the items, I think people should just be encouraged to use the more sustainable options without forcing everyone to by banning the use/sale of them. Or at least until a more viable solution for everyone can be created.\n\n12 more replies\nSJFreezerburn\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nCapri Sun, Kool Aid jammers, water bottles, juice boxes too....\n\nGo all in and ban them or GTFO with this half measure plastic straw bullshit...\n\nOh and find out which countres are contributing to the plastic island in the Pacific and make them clean that shit up...\n\n4 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nPlastic straws are a problem because they aren’t caught by machinery in recycling plants.

Not that hard.\n\n3 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nSometimes society looks for irrational scapegoats for problems.\n\nThe formula is usually:\n\nSomething strange/bad is happening and there's nothing we can do about it. So let's blame this object/minority\n\nCows not giving milk? Mysterious miscarriages? No rain? Bad harvest? Well dried up? Plague? Long-term environmental issues?\n\nBlame something and crusade against it to feel like you're doing something\n\nThat-Ad-9834\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nPeople really use paper straws I thought everyone stopped using them as soon as they found out how sucky they were. Besides we are still using plastic cups has anyone even tried foam straws or is that dumb idea too?\n\nheckdoggo111111\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nPlastic straws aren’t the problem. It’s the people who throw them on the ground after using them.\n\nFjellbjorn\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nThe world's still dying and I'm stuck drinking my soda out of this fuckin' soggy tube.\n\nThis is gonna sound crazy, but you can drink straight from the glass without a straw.\n\n12 more replies\n[deleted]\n•\n3 yr. ago\n•\nEdited 3 yr. ago\n\nAre straws even necessary? I get that for people with disabilities, it's obviously the only way they can drink something. But for most people drinking straight from the cup should be the default. Is it really so hard to bring the cup up to your lips and take a sip?\n\nEdit: This also eliminates the need for plastic lids if you're eating inside the restaurant. Still probably necessary for takeout though.\n\n7 more replies\nPrincess_S78\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nJust don’t use a straw or get stainless, bamboo, or silicone reusable straws. I have stainless and I love them! But you aren’t wrong about Amazon, it pisses me off the amount of wasteful packaging they use.\n\nTHEKINDHERO\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nGet yourself a metal/glass straw.\n\nGot a few my self. They're great\n\n[deleted]\n•\n3 yr. ago\n\nNot great for disabled people or kids.
