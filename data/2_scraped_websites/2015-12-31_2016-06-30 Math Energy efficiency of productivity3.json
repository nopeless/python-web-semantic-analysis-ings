You should be able to just copy & paste the formulae to verify them for yourself. The values in this post are lower bounds as they do assume no assembler downtime and inserter energy costs. Also tileable designs that rely on beacon sharing between modules (3-5) are assumed to always share all beacons.\n\nOne assembler, zero beacons:(1)\n\n(w*(1 + b*0.7 + p*0.8)+(b*480/m))/((1 + -0.15*p + 0.5*b)*(1 + p*0.1)*s), w = 210, s = 1.25, p = 4, b = 0, m = 1\n= 1260 kJ\n\nRing of assemblers around one beacon:(2)\n\n(w*(1 + b*0.7 + p*0.8)+(b*480/m))/((1 + -0.15*p + 0.5*b)*(1 + p*0.1)*s), w = 210, s = 1.25, p = 4, b = 1, m = 12\n= 678.73 kJ\n\nRing of beacons around one assembler:(3)\n\n(w*(1 + b*0.7 + p*0.8)+(b*480/m))/((1 + -0.15*p + 0.5*b)*(1 + p*0.1)*s), w = 210, s = 1.25, p = 4, b = 12, m = 12/5\n= 450.54 kJ\n\nBeacon sandwich:(4)\n\n(w*(1 + b*0.7 + p*0.8)+(b*480/m))/((1 + -0.15*p + 0.5*b)*(1 + p*0.1)*s), w = 210, s = 1.25, p = 4, b = 4, m = 8\n= 407.14 kJ\n\nAlternating rows of beacons and assemblers:(5)\n\n(w*(1 + b*0.7 + p*0.8)+(b*480/m))/((1 + -0.15*p + 0.5*b)*(1 + p*0.1)*s), w = 210, s = 1.25, p = 4, b = 8, m = 8\n= 329.61 kJ\nRead more\nasgardswrath2.com\nLearn More\nSort by:\nAdd a Comment\nvoldkost\n•\n8 yr. ago\n\nEfficiency is boring.

I assumed that spreading the beacon cost would be the most energy efficient setup. (I've not really worked with 4xProd3's or beacons, at all.)
