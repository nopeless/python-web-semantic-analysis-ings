  "body": "These are mouthpieces that press into the top of a straw (they work with the tubing straws mentioned above, or with most regular .25\" diameter straws like these). They are hard plastic, which means that even if you bite on the straw, they keep the straw open so you can still drink from it and don't bite it shut."
