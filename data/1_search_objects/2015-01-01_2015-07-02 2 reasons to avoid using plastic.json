  "body": "When I was a child, I used to use plastic straws a lot for drinking, especially when it was for soda or came with the numerous Tetra Pak milk or juice single-servings I was made to drink regularly.I loved using them, especially when they had bellows for bending (I remember getting irritated when the straws were straight, as I couldn't be lazier in sipping my drinks)."
