  "body": "We suck up soda, water and other beverages, all through plastic straws. So many of us suck that the U.S. uses, and discards, 500 million plastic straws a day \u2014 enough to wrap around the earth two-and-a-half times. What seems like a small piece of insignificant plastic adds up to 12 million pounds of plastic waste in the United States every year."
