  "body": "This explains why plastic pollution is becoming such a big issue; it accumulates at a much faster rate than it can decompose or degrade into a harmless form. Some plastics take longer than others to decompose: Plastic bags - 10 to 1,000 years. Foam plastic cup - 50 years. Plastic bottle - 450 years or more. Nylon fishing line - 600 years."
