  "body": "I think an easy to wash reusable straw is a bit of an oxymoron. By nature, a slender hollow tube is always going to be annoying to clean. But as long as we rinse the straws right after using them, it's just an extra minute to get the pipe cleaner through them. Recommend either metal, bamboo, or silicone."
