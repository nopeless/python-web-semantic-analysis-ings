  "body": "Obvious plastic pollution occurs where humans directly litter, such as roadsides, beaches, river banks, and urban estuaries. This type of plastic pollution is, in principle, readily reversible at the local scale because it can be physically removed by cleanups, and because littering can be curtailed through public campaigns and with improved waste collection infrastructure."
