  "body": "Aka no colorant added. Also depending on the plastic that can be crystal clear, milky clear, beige, black, amber. Most plastics start in a tan or beige color (although a few are clear). So in theory, uncolored should be your cheapest. But black is usually done with carbon black, which is very cheap as well."
