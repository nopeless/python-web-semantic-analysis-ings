  "body": "Plastic straw bans kinda piss me off. I don't think they should be the default straw given to people, but I think they should be an option. I have a disability that affects my whole body, in addition to celiacs, and it makes it nearly impossible to drink without a straw, and other issues make non plastic straws a really bad choice for me."
