  "body": "Straws themselves are nessesary (I have dysphagia due to a chronic illness, I can't drink without a straw) but plastic, single use straws are not nessesary.. I have a curved metal straw I carry with me so I can drink, and my brother who has the same illness has a durable plastic, reusable straw which will last ~5 years, has a bit more flexibility to it."
