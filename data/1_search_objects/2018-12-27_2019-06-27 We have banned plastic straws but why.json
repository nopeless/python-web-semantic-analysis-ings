  "body": "For one, plastic straws are actually quite unnecessary and are usually wasted in high amounts. On the other hand they are quite easily replacable if you really need a straw. Last but not least, bottles are easier to recycle. In germany we have a well working way of handling plastic bottles. You pay a fee of 0.25\u20ac per plastic bottle."
