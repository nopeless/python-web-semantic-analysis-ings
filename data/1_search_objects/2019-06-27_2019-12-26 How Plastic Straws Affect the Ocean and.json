  "body": "Plastic straws are one of the top 10 items found every year during Ocean Conservancy's International Coastal Cleanup. Plastic is not biodegradable \u2014 instead, the material eventually breaks down into tiny particles known as microplastics that are 5 millimeters or smaller in length, making them difficult to clean or filter from the ocean."
