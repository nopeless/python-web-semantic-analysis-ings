  "body": "Both the Fehu and the Cirth (g) runes appear similar in either runic alphabet as an F with upturned arms. It's the killers way of commemorating the event, marking his territory, his presence, his kill. We can see a similar marking in the Hobbit where Gandalf carves the same F shaped rune into Bilbo Baggins door."
