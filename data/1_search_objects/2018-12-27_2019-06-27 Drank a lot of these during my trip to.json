  "body": "Everything has to be quick and convienient at the cost of taste and tonnes and tonnes of plastic pollution. Each to their own ... Lots of plastic bottle collection bins lying around. So didn't feel like it was actually all that bad. I dont think I'd buy plastic bottles if this was in say, USA where the recycling is dubious."
