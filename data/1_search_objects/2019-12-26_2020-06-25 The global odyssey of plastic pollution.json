  "body": "Open in viewer. Researchers now recognize that plastic cycles through more than just the ocean. To be sure, the ocean is a sink for micro plastics. But as ecologists learn more about these particles, they realize that the ocean is not always the final fate of microplastics; rather, the ocean is one part of the global plastic cycle."
