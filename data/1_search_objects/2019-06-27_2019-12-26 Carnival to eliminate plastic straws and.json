  "body": "For the disabled, elderly, or people with mobility issues, plastic straws are often easier to use than straw alternatives. In these cases, if people choose to bring their own, I hope they wouldn't be penalized. If a small stash of plastic straws can be kept onboard (all cruise ships) for those who truly need them, I think that would be best."
