  "body": "Vegetables and carbs produce the most of the gas, but meat does that too. I tried to go low carb and I was immediatley costipated and had less gas production. I have gastritis, 3 ulcers (endodcopy), and probably histamine intollerance too, cause a lot of things which I was not allergic to, started give me reactions (itchy skin, breathing problems)"
