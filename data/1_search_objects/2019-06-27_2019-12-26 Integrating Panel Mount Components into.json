  "body": "Hi folks. I am a PCB newbie and am looking for some guidance on integrating panel mount components into a PCB circuit. I understand how through hole components work on a breadboard/stripboard, and how SMD components work on a PCB, but I am a little fuzzy on how panel mount components or through hole components get assembled into a PCB."
