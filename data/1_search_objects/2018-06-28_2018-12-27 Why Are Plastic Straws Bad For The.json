  "body": "The environmental impact of plastic straws is well documented. Because plastic has a lifecycle that extends long after it's served any function, single-use products often wind up in landfills or, even worse, the ocean. In 2015, marine biologist Christine Figgener shot a disturbing video of a turtle with a straw stuck in its nostril."
