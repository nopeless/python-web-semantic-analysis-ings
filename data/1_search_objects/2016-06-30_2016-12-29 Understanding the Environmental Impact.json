  "body": "Some straws are incinerated, which adds toxic chemicals into the atmosphere. Most straws go into landfills where they live forever since plastic isn't biodegradable. When buried in the ground, straws leach harmful chemicals into the soil and groundwater. The rest end up floating into streams, rivers and eventually the ocean."
