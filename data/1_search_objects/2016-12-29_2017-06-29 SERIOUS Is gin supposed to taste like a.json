  "body": "When consumed alone, it does taste like that, and theoretically it should taste like that. Obviously there are gins where this \"pine note\" (i.e. juniper berries) will be very characteristic, and there are gins where it is not so pronounced. Very cheap gins simply taste like alcohol. When mixed with tonic, it should not have that taste."
