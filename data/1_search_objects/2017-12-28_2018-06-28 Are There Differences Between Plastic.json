  "body": "He can't really shapeshift and uses his powers in actually serious ways. It may seem redundant but the thing is, Elongated Man is a hero supposed to be taken seriously, with limited powers and a normal attitude. Plastic Man is a comic relief character, who is more powerful but doesn't really put much effort into things."
