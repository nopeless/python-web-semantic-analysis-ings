  "body": "plastic degrades over time and with stress cycles. The same thing that happened to those buckles is happening to some degree to the rest of the skate's plastic parts. This skate looks between 10 and 15 years old, if you can afford it go with a new pair. If not u/eck226's idea of the Bauer buckles is a good one."
