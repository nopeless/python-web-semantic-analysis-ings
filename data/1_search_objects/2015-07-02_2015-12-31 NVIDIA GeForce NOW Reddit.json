  "body": "I have Samsung OLED and Shield TV Pro 2017. I noticed that there is considerable latency when using Geforce now on shield. Network latency is unchanged but there is more latency to the game and you can notice it. When playing on the built in app on Samsung TV the game feels local, it's really good but doesn't have HDR."
