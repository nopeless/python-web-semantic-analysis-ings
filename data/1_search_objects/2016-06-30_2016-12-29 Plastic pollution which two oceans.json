  "body": "It is estimated that around 80% of the world's plastic pollution comes from land-based use, and around 20% from marine-going vessels. Discarded plastic is blown from overfilled garbage cans, from landfills and from vehicles; much of it ending up in rivers and streams, which then carry the items into the ocean."
