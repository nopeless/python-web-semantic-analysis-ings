  "body": "Plastic straws are expected to be the next biggest sustainability concern in foodservice disposables. As a nation, it is estimated that we go through 500 million straws a day which, at best, wind up in the landfill. At worst, they end up in rivers, streams, and oceans where they can be ingested by wildlife and marine mammals."
