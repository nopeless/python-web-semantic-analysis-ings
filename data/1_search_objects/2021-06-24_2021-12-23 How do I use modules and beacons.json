  "body": "The typical thing to do is to put T3 productivity modules in anything that will take them (except miners and pumpjacks), and surround them by beacons using T3 speed modules. Beacons can only take speed and efficiency, and efficiency doesn't make sense as beacons use a lot of power and the efficiency modules don't affect the beacon power usage."
