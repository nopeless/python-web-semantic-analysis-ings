  "body": "Damage Radius: 1.2 tiles \u2192 1.5 tiles. The baby dragon's place in the meta hasn't fluctuated by much recently. For the most part, it tends to be just a bit below average. So I think a buff to its damage radius will be helpful. I think its health and splash damage is good for a 4-elixir card."
