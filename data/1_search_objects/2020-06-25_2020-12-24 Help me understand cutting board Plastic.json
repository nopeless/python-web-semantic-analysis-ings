  "body": "I'd say get a cheap plastic board for meat and fish and then a nice end grain for everything else. Also plastic can harbour bacteria but some woods are very good for there anti bacterial properties. Check out Epicurean boards. Compressed wood: dishwasher safe, heat safe. And you can sand it back to smooth."
