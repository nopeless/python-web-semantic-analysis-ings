  "body": "Get a pack of reusable straws they are like $20 and come with like 6-8 straws. I saw in a comment that you think you would forget to bring it but you could just keep 2 with you in your school bag. Wash them when you wash the rest of your dishes. You can also wash them any place the water is drinkable."
