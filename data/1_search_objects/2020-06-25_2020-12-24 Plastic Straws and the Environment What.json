  "body": "Because plastic straws are small and light, they are regularly blown out of rubbish bins, refuse vehicles, and landfill sites by the wind. They can then quickly find their way to watercourses and be washed into the sea. Finally, along with other small plastic items, straws can be ingested by birds scavenging at landfill sites."
