  "body": "That is like 1.6 straws for every man, woman and child living in this country\u2026 every single day. If you were to take an entire day's worth of plastic straws we use in one day, it would fill up over 127 school busses. That is like over 46,400 school buses full of one-time use plastic straws that are ending up in our landfills and waterways."
