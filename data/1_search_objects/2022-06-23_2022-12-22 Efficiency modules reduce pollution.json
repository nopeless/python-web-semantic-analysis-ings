  "body": "If you can put speed modules into them then they absorb a lot more pollution though. It works a little backwards, we have these greenhouses from K2 that absorb pollution from atmosphere instead of generating it by 5/m. When you add 2 Eff 1 modules it goes \"up\" to -0.8 absorbed, instead of increasing."
