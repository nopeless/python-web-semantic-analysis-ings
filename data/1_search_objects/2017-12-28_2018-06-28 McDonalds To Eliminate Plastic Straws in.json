  "body": "Paper straws used to be the default before plastic became so popular (the reason everyone switched to plastic btw. was environmental - deforestation from all the paper use was becoming a serious problem). It was great for quick use, but if you left it too long the paper got soggy and the straw blocked, which defeated the point."
