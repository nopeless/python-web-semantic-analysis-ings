  "body": "Paper cups and straws are coated in wax to make them temporarily water proof and permanently unrecyclable aka single use and disposable. Plastic cups and straws can be recycled and reused almost indefinitely, but most people use them as single use products because the plastic is too thin to wash without melting in most dishwashers."
