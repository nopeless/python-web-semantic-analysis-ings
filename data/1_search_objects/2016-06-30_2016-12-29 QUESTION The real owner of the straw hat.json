  "body": "Roger was the original (or at least earliest known owner) since his first meeting with Rayleigh. Yeah you must've missed the part where they said shanks got the hat from gold roger. They even showed the scene where roger was younger and he was wearing the hat. They really need to explain why roger looked like luffy when he was younger."
