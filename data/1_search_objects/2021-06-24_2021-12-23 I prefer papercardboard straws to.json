  "body": "I also enjoy the resilience of plastic straws, you can bend them but they don't break easily. Also makes a good chewing device that helps me focus. I doubt the environmental impact is actually much of a difference. If I recall the straws are wrapped in plastic, whereas plastic straws were wrapped in paper."
