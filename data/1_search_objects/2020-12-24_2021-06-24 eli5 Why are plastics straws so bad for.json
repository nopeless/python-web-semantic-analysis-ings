  "body": "The controversy of plastic straws and turtles arose from this video uploaded to YouTube in 2015. In it a turtle has what appears to be a plastic straw lodged rather deep up one of its nostrils. The individual in the video (a researcher named Christine Figgener) posted a write up about the incident in a Nature journal article."
