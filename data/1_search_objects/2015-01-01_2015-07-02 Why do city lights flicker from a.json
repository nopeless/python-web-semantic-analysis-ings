  "body": "Hot air has lower density and thus lower refractive index than colder air, so a pocket of warmer air will slightly distort the path light takes from its source to your eye. If you were rather far away from the city lights, it's very well possible that the flickering comes from turbulent warmer regions of air between the lights and you."
