  "body": "Vasodilation, such as that caused by alcohol, causes you to feel warm but actually lowers your body temperature. Your blood is warm because it travels through your core. When you drink alcohol, or take a different vasodilator, more blood travels to your skin. Since the blood is warmer than the skin, this warms the skin and causes you to feel warm."
