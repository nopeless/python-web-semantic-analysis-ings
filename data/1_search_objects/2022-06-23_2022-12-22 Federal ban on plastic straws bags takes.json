  "body": "Bottom line: plastic straws feel bad but are recyclable; paper straws feel good but are destined to end up in the landfill. Some certainly are biodegradable, but many are not (McDonalds' for instance are not recyclable at all and must be thrown out). Paper straws also require more energy and water to produce than a plastic straw."
