  "body": "Plastic straws, were in fact, banned on the space flights in case they blew up over the ocean. But really though, I think the ban on plastic straws was leaning towards wildlife safety, not just pollution. Sea gulls, fish, turtle, seals, for some reason love to eat that kind of trash and stuff and is obviously very bad for them."
