  "body": "Most takeout coffee cups are paper lined with a thin layer of plastic, making them neither compostable nor recyclable. Also PLA (compostable plastic) coffee cup lids are an option. Or at the very least the city could ban lids made from black plastic (black plastic is less recyclable than white or transparent plastic)."
