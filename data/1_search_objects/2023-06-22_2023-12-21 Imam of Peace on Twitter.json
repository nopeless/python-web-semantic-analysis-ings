  "body": "This leader has a vision that goes beyond picking a fight with plastic straws. In just 50 years, he and his late father have achieved more economic growth for the UAE \ud83c\udde6\ud83c\uddea than any other country in the world. He was the first to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement, commit to an economy-wide reduction in emissions and announce an initiative to achieve net zero by 2050."
