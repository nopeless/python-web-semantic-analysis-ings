  "body": "Creating solid fuel from petroleum, refined by basic processing and gathered by a pumpjack emits 1.583 pollution per unit of solid fuel when Y = 1. In other words, that's 7.579 MJ per pollution. So burning coal is 3 times more efficient energy-wise and 1.33 times more efficient pollution-wise than basic oil processing into solid fuel."
