  "body": "If it's a cheap, imported kazoo, the resonator (that little piece of paper) is probably cellophane and may or may not recover from being wet. If you can pry the cap out you can replace it. A plastic grocery bag stretched under the cap usually works pretty well. Or you could just buy another kazoo - preferably one with a water resistant resonator."
