  "body": "A new study shows that the U.S. is the largest producer of plastic waste in the world, producing about 42 million metric tons of it in 2016. The report also reveals that the U.S. ranks among the top contributors of litter, illegally dumped trash and other mismanaged waste to its shorelines. The study challenges the blame-Asia narrative and calls for more action at home to manage its waste."
