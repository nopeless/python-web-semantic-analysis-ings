  "body": "The world generates around 350 million tonnes of plastic waste per year. That means that around 2% of waste is traded. The remaining 98% is handled domestically. It's sent to a landfill, recycled, or incinerated in the country where the waste was generated. The idea that most of the world's plastic waste is shipped overseas is incorrect."
