  "body": "If Caeser joined the Straw hats all of the show's credibility is immediately gone. I do think he will joins Buggy's crew however, because he is a comic relief character who will probably remain in the story, is an idiot, and thematically fits Buggy's crew. Also the clowns could use a heavy hitter now that Buggy is a warlord."
