  "body": "If we assume a business as usual projection with growing populations, increasing plastic consumption and increased waste generation, by 2025, this number doubles - we may be adding 17.5 million metric tons of plastic per year. If that happens, then our cumulative input over time from 2010 to 2025 is projected to be 155 million metric tons."
