  "body": "Boston Market is the most underrated Fast Food chain. Tastes good, is healthy, is fairly quick, have a decent amount of options, and isn't too overpriced. I mean sure, if you don't love chicken it's probably not the best place for you, but I can't think of a chain where you can order a healthier meal that tastes as good. This thread is archived."
