  "body": "The plastic straw descends from a long line of assistive drinking devices \u2014 perhaps most notably, the ingenuity of the ancient Sumerians who used long, thin, metal tubes to drink \"beer\" 5,000 years ago. It is closest in kin to the paper drinking straw, first patented in 1888 by Marvin Stone, a paper-cigarette-holder manufacturer."
