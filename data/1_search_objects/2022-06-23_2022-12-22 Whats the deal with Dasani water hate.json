  "body": "Answer: A number of people hate anyone that pollutes our planet with plastic bottles that don't ever get recycled. Simply purchasing 36 bottles would set a lot of people off because of the environmental impacts. No one hates those that drink from the tap. Consider reusing all those bottles and purchasing a water filter."
