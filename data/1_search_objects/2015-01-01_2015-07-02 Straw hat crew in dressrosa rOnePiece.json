  "body": "I would say that the Straw Hat crew gained most the allies themselves, where as Luffy only gained a few himself. Luffy helped Law, Rebecca, and Ex-Don Chinjao. Then later on gaining Cabbage's respect. Sanji got Violet, Zoro did something, Franky helped with Soldier-san, Robin with Revolutionaries/Rebecca."
