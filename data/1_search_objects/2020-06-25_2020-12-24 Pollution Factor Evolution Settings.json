  "body": "However the default pollution factor is only 9. This seems dreadfully low, what is the maximum value for this? Obviously it's 1000, but even on deathworld the maximum evolution factors are at 200. I previously used settings between 100 and 200 for all the factors and I did not find the biter evolution rate challenging enough."
