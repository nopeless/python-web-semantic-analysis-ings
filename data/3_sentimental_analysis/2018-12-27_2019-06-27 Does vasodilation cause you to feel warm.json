  "body": "Vasodilation, such as that caused by alcohol, causes you to feel warm but actually lowers your body temperature. Your blood is warm because it travels through your core. When you drink alcohol, or take a different vasodilator, more blood travels to your skin. Since the blood is warmer than the skin, this warms the skin and causes you to feel warm.",
  "readable_content": "- psychomama (2018-12-07): Does vasodilation cause you to feel warm or cold?\n\n- dromio05 (2018-12-07): Vasodilation, such as that caused by alcohol, causes you to feel warm but actually lowers your body temperature. When you drink alcohol, more blood travels to your skin, which warms the skin and causes you to feel warm. However, if the air around you is cold, heat from your blood will be transferred to the air, causing your body temperature to drop.\n\n- GrouchyDevotee (2018-12-07): Alcohol will cause vasodilation and make your extremities feel warm briefly, but it eventually results in a lower core body temperature, which can lead to hypothermia.\n\n- Rising_Falling (2018-12-07): Vasodilation of the blood vessels fluctuates based on environmental needs. Alcohol causes dilation, while a stimulant would cause constriction. The effects continue until the drug is metabolized out of the body and systems return to homeostasis.\n\n- Lajeer (2018-12-07): Alcohol only makes you feel warm if you are already cold. It increases blood flow to the extremities, but this ultimately results in a lower core body temperature.",
