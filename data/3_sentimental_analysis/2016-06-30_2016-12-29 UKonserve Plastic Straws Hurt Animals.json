  "readable_content": "User (2023-12-08): How Straws Affect Animals and Ecosystems\n\nConsidering more than 90 percent of all trash floating in the world\u2019s oceans is plastic, it\u2019s logical that plastic accounts for the most harmful man-made items in the ocean. But what we often forget is that animals are ingesting this plastic waste every day, especially straws.\n\nMany marine biologists, photographers, and sea lovers have captured the impact of single-use plastic on animals. As the plastic travels into and around the ocean, it breaks into tiny pieces that are then easily ingested by marine life. These are the top animals affected by single-use straws in the ocean:\n\n- Seabirds\n- Fish\n- Sea Turtles\n\nSwitching the straw may seem small on the individual level, but the impact it can have on the environment and animals is huge. To help you get started, we\u2019re offering a Free Straw Brush with every Stainless Steel Straw 2-Pack through September.
