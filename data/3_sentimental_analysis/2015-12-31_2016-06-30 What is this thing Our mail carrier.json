  "readable_content": "- USMC0317 (2015-12-08): What is this thing? Our mail carrier keeps leaving it in our mailbox?\n  ![image](imgur.com)\n  - CaptainOatboats: Your carrier uses that as a marker and puts it with your mail to let them know they have a package for you. They're most likely not realizing they're leaving it in your box.\n  - IMissBeingMe: Put it back in the box with a small cookie, mint, etc. Tiny things like that are never forgotten and almost always ensure your package gets that extra attention. Bonus points for a funny note like \"You can pick either one. I keep the label, you get the cookie ;)\" Stuff like that totally makes our day. The job is hard and mistakes like this are embarrassing but they happen. Letting him off the hook with a joke is a very nice gesture.\n  It also serves to remind him next time not to F it up. Ugh...CCA's...amiright?\n  (J/K, I love you guys!)\n  - Skeetronic: New guy filling in on your route.
