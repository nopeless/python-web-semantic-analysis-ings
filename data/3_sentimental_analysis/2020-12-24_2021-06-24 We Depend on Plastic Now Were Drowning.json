Of that, more than 6.9 billion tons have become waste. And of that waste, a staggering 6.3 billion tons never made it to a recycling bin\u2014a figure that stunned the scientists who crunched the numbers in 2017.\n\nNo one knows how much unrecycled plastic waste ends up in the ocean, Earth\u2019s last sink. In 2015, Jenna Jambeck, a University of Georgia engineering professor, caught everyone\u2019s attention with a rough estimate: between 5.3 million and 14 million tons each year just from coastal regions.\n\nMeanwhile, ocean plastic is estimated to kill millions of marine animals every year. Nearly 700 species, including endangered ones, are known to have been affected by it. Some are harmed visibly\u2014strangled by abandoned fishing nets or discarded six-pack rings. Many more are probably harmed invisibly. Marine species of all sizes, from zooplankton to whales, now eat microplastics, the bits smaller than one-fifth of an inch across.\n\nAnd yet there\u2019s a key difference: Ocean plastic is not as complicated as climate change. There are no ocean trash deniers, at least so far. To do something about it, we don\u2019t have to remake our planet\u2019s entire energy system.\n\nIn Plymouth, under the gray gloom of an English autumn, Richard Thompson waited in a yellow slicker outside Plymouth University\u2019s Coxside Marine Station, at the edge of the harbor. A lean man of 54, with a smooth pate rimmed with gray hair, Thompson was headed for an ordinary career as a marine ecologist in 1993\u2014he was working on a Ph.D. on limpets and microalgae that grow on coastal rocks\u2014when he participated in his first beach cleanup, on the Isle of Man. While other volunteers zoomed in on the plastic bottles and bags and nets, Thompson focused on the small stuff, the tiny particles that lay underfoot, ignored, at the high tide line.\n\nIn the years since his first beach cleanup, Thompson has helped provide the beginnings of an answer: The missing plastic is getting broken into pieces so small they\u2019re hard to see. In a 2004 paper, Thompson coined the term \u201cmicroplastics\u201d for these small bits, predicting\u2014accurately, as it turned out\u2014that they had \u201cpotential for large-scale accumulation\u201d in the ocean.",
  "summary": "The passage raises awareness about the significant impact of plastic pollution on the environment and marine life. It highlights the alarming amount of plastic waste that ends up in the ocean, leading to harm and death for millions of marine animals. The text also emphasizes the role of microplastics in adding to the problem. Overall, the sentiment conveyed is one of concern for the environmental and ecological consequences of plastic waste.\n\nSentiment: 0.9",
