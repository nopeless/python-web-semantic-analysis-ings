The straw dates back to at least 3000 B.C., when Sumerians drank beer through tubes made of gold. In the 1800s, people used stalks of rye as straws. The paper straw was introduced in 1888, but by the 1970s, plastic straws became popular.\n\nToday, straws are widely used. About 170 million to 490 million plastic straws are used in the United States each day. Straws offer an easy, sanitary way to drink beverages. They also help people with disabilities safely consume liquids.\n\nHowever, drinking through a straw may have more drawbacks than benefits. The practice can lead to negative health and environmental effects over time.\n\nBenefits of drinking through a straw\n- Increases convenience\n- Improves hygiene\n- Helps people with disabilities\n- Prevents staining of front teeth\n\nDrawbacks of drinking through a straw\n- Causes smoker\u2019s lips\n- Causes bloating and excess gas\n- Stains your back teeth\n- Increases alcohol intake\n\nOther downsides to plastic straws\n- Create air pollution during production\n- Can't be recycled effectively\n- Pollute the ocean and endanger marine life\n- Accumulate hazardous air pollutants (HAPs)\n\nTakeaway\nIf you have a motor or swallowing disorder, straws can help you safely drink beverages. Otherwise, if you only use straws for convenience, it may be healthier to ditch them. Drinking through a straw can contribute to lip wrinkles, bloating, cavities, and teeth staining.\n\nIf you must drink through a straw, consider using a reusable straw to reduce plastic waste. The production and disposal of plastic straws contribute to environmental pollution.",
