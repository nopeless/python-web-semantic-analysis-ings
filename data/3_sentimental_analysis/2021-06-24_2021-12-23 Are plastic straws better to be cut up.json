  "readable_content": "- LimitGroundbreaking2 (2021-12-08): Are plastic straws better to be cut up or left alone when disposing? I've always wondered if this would have any potential impact on its impact to the environment?\n- Forget-Me-Nothing (2021-12-08): As far as I was aware, cutting them so that they could be unrolled into a long rectangle was the right thing to do. I can't for the life of me remember why though!\n- PierogiAndNegroni (2021-12-08): I think cutting them lengthwise would prevent anything getting lodged in there and also reduce the likelihood of it getting lodged in something (or someone) itself? I haven\u2019t thought about that one before- good question!\n- ailiesm (2021-12-08): I would say there\u2019s downsides to both, leaving it whole risks it getting imbedded in marine life and cutting it up makes it easier to get eaten by marine/wildlife, going on to be microplastics etc. It\u2019s best to not use them to avoid them entering the ecosystem completely.\n- LimitGroundbreaking2 (2021-12-08): Well I bought a reusable straw but Im just asking for other cases I may encounter straws in my life\n- woke_pug (2021-12-08): If you put it in a well-enclosed bin in a place with landfill services, then most likely it will end up in the landfill and not the ocean. Most ocean plastic comes from loose waste, typically from countries that do not have widely-available waste disposal services.\n- LacedVelcro (2021-12-08): If your municipality doesn't recycle them, then the best place for them is a modern landfill, where the carbon is sequestered underground and the plastic can't leach into the waterway. I would say keeping the straw intact increases the likelihood of it successfully making it to the landfill without falling out somewhere. It also makes it easier for a good citizen to make sure that it gets r/DeTrashed, if it does end up as litter. Better yet is demand your municipality/State/country implement a phase out of single use plastics, which has been effective in many places. Always vote your environmental concerns and voice your concerns to anyone who will listen.\n- pedalikwac (2021-12-08): Put small plastics and films into plastic bottles a la ecobrick\n- [deleted] (2021-12-08): Don't do this in countries where these items are recyclable. Items that can be recycled need to be completely separate, if a human has to intervene to get stuff out of other stuff it automatically goes to the ovens, not worth the hassle\n- p3pp3rmint_kitti3 (2021-12-08): I\u2019d say maybe just leave them whole? I doubt many animals can get inside them, but I think I saw a video once of a sea turtle with a straw way up its nose, some guys pulled it out. I think it\u2019s bad cut or uncut, sadly. That said, you\u2019re incredibly thoughtful to try and look at this issue from another perspective and come up with a solution. I wish you luck and a good day!\n- ReduceMyRows (2021-12-08): Makes me wonder if a cut up straw somehow is less likely to go up a turtle's nose, I think not.\n- ReduceMyRows (2021-12-08): If you have a shredder you can shred them to be extra safe =)",
