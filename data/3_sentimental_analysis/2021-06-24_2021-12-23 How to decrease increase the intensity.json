  "readable_content": "- sijmen_v_b (2021-12-08): Yea, so the custom plants layer is a bit stupid, what you do is you add netherwart as if it where adding air since worldpainter will try to place netherwart but that can only be done on soulsand which is most likely not on your terrain (if it is you can use other plants that fail to spawn such as water plants on dry land) so since you have no soul sand it fails and doesn't place anything. This is how you add air to your plants layer effectively controlling the intencity.\n\n- Nick-Urban (2021-12-08): Took my a couple reads to understand but I understand now - thank you! :)\n    - 1 more reply",
