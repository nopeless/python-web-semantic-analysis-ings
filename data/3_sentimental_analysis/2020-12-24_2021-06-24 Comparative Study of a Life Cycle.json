The research evaluates the global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP) of both types of straws. The study finds that bio-plastic straws have reduced environmental impacts compared to paper straws, providing insight into their potential to promote sustainability, especially from the perspective of Malaysia.\n\n- User (2023-12-08): Introduction to Plastic Pollution and Environmental Impacts\nPlastic pollution poses serious environmental and health risks at a global scale. Malaysia is particularly affected, ranking as the eighth-worst country for mismanagement of plastic waste. Strategies to reduce plastic waste include the use of bio-plastics, such as polylactic acid (PLA) straws, and paper straws. Both of these alternatives aim to address the environmental impacts of conventional plastic straws and promote sustainability.\n\n- User (2023-12-08): Environmental Impact Assessment\nThe study utilizes life cycle assessment (LCA) to evaluate the environmental impacts of bio-plastic and paper straws. It considers factors such as global warming potential, acidification potential, and eutrophication potential. The environmental impact categories are crucial in understanding the overall effects of these straw alternatives on the environment. The article presents data on the prevalence of plastic straws in marine litter pollution, emphasizing the need for sustainable alternatives.\n\n- User (2023-12-08): Conclusion\nThe research underscores the importance of sustainable alternatives to conventional plastic straws and highlights the potential of bio-plastic and paper straws in reducing the environmental impact of single-use plastic products. The study\u2019s findings provide valuable insights into the potential benefits of bio-plastic and paper straws, especially in the context of Malaysia.",
