  "body": "Abstract. Plastic marine debris pollution is rapidly becoming one of the critical environmental concerns facing wildlife in the 21st century. Here we present a risk analysis for plastic ingestion by sea turtles on a global scale. We combined global marine plastic distributions based on ocean drifter data with sea turtle habitat maps to predict ...",
  "readable_content": "-User (2023-12-08): This website contains a research article on the global risk analysis for marine debris ingestion by sea turtles. It highlights the impact of plastic marine debris pollution on sea turtles and presents a risk analysis based on global marine plastic distributions and sea turtle habitat maps. The study reveals that oceanic life-stage sea turtles, particularly olive ridley turtles, are at the highest risk of debris ingestion, and it identifies regions of highest risk to global sea turtle populations. The article also discusses the potential percentage of sea turtles globally at risk of debris ingestion based on available data.",
