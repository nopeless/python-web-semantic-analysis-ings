That\u2019s the equivalent of two garbage trucks emptying a load of plastic rubbish into the sea every minute.\n\nPlastic is interlaced with nearly every aspect of human life, from shopping bags and food packages to car parts and cell phones. But once it enters the ocean, plastic can remain there for hundreds of years, breaking down into ever-smaller pieces that are nearly impossible to remove. Plastic debris is also deadly to marine life, such as when they either mistake it for food and starve as it fills their stomachs or get entangled by the plastic and drown.\n\n- User (2023-12-08): Breaking the Plastic Wave | Pew",
