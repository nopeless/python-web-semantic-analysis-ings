  "readable_content": "- PhantomFav (2019-09-04): Finally I have solved the map generation BUG!\nAfter 1 month of trial and error, I have discovered how to solve this problem: stopping to use the Permadeath Mode. In fact, this happens on the Save/Load Mode too, but when you load the game a second time during the same session at RW, the game will continue normally! This happens even if you load the same save that the first time has given to you the \"empty map bug\". The saves are not corrupted... they are still there, and they work perfectly.\nThis obviously wasn't possible with Permadeath because when you have that map, the only 3 options are \"save the game and go to menu\", \"save the game and exit from RW\", and these obviously overwrite your game with the empty map, or you can press Alt+F4, but when you will restart RW, the bug will be there another time (when it starts to happen, it literally happens every time you load that save).\nIt was so simple! I don't care about Permadeath anymore, and to live the same kind of experience, I usually keep loading the last saved game without bothering with the past ones.\nDo you think I should make a request in the Bug Section on Ludeon Studios to solve permanently this bug?\n\n- Moasseman (2019-09-04): Do you think I should make a request in the Bug Section on Ludeon Studios to solve permanently this bug?\nNo, you should figure out which mod causes this issue and then report it to them.\n\n- AutoModerator (2019-09-04): If this post is in regards to a potential bug in the game, please consider cross-posting to the bug reporting section on the Ludeon forums.\n\n- TheVillageGuy (2019-09-04): Of course get it fixed, the less bugs in a game the more time people can spend actually playing it!",
