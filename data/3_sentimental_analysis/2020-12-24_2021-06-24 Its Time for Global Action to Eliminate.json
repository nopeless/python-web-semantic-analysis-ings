It regulates the climate, sustains an estimated 2.2 million species, provides critical protein to 3.3 billion people, and supports tens of millions of jobs.* However, marine plastic pollution is increasing rapidly, as expanding plastic production and use exceed our ability to manage them appropriately. As the United Nations Environment Assembly noted in Resolution UNEP/E.A.4/Res.9 in 2019, high and rapidly increasing levels of macro- and microplastic pollution represent a serious global environmental problem, adversely affecting marine biodiversity, ecosystems, livelihoods, fisheries, maritime transport, recreation and tourism, and local societies and economies; costing billions of dollars annually; and posing health risks to people.\n\n- As societies around the world adapt to new economic realities amid the COVID-19 pandemic, they have an opportunity to build a more resilient environment, economy, and society. Now is not the time to move backward on eliminating plastic waste and pollution. Tackling ocean plastic pollution is also essential to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals\u2014target 14.1 on marine pollution, goal 12 on responsible consumption and production, and more.\n\n- A 2020 report by The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ\u2014in partnership with the University of Oxford, the University of Leeds, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, and Common Seas\u2014and an accompanying scientific paper estimate that without additional action, the annual flow of plastic entering the ocean will nearly triple by 2040. Furthermore, even if all current major industry and government commitments are met, these measures are likely to reduce annual plastic leakage to the ocean by only around 7 per cent in 2040 relative to the current trajectory.\n\n- Over the past two decades, the number of public policy responses to this issue has been increasing at both the national and international levels, according to an analysis by Duke University. However, major gaps remain in many regions and in the types of plastics addressed; few countries have yet embraced a more comprehensive policy approach or monitored policy effectiveness; and there is no global, binding target for reducing plastic pollution.\n- \n- We, as signatories of this statement, recognize the urgent need for collective global action to halt and reverse the rapid increase in plastic pollution and create a circular economy for plastics. Reaching the goal of near-zero plastic pollution entering the ocean by 2040 and reducing overall greenhouse gas emissions from plastics throughout their life cycle requires systemic change, with a concurrent, timely focus on six areas:\n\n- Reducing plastic production and consumption by, as a priority, eliminating all avoidable plastic use and establishing reuse and refill systems. In addition, where relevant and beneficial, substituting plastic products with other materials, ensuring sustainable sourcing and compatibility with waste management and resource recovery infrastructure.\n- Designing all products and packaging\u2014whether made of plastic or a substitute material\u2014to be reused, recycled, or composted in environmentally benign systems that are practical to implement at scale, with a focus on finding alternatives or solutions for multimaterial and small-format flexible plastic items that disproportionately contribute to macroplastic pollution and are not recyclable economically, addressing hazardous substances in plastics, and reducing virgin plastic inputs.\n- Improving and creating new waste management services, with a focus on increasing collection, reuse, and recycling rates; providing long-term funding; developing circular systems; securing livelihoods, fair payment, and safe working conditions for formal and informal waste collectors; and filling key capacity gaps in middle- and low-income countries.\n- Restricting and regulating transboundary movements of plastic waste, with export only to countries with a proven capacity to manage and recycle both imported and domestically generated waste in accordance with globally accepted environmental and health and safety standards. In addition, eliminating exports of dirty and contaminated plastic waste to developing countries.\n- Tackling microplastic pollution by using alternative materials and developing improved standards and capture technologies to reduce microplastic release from tyres and textiles, setting mandatory supply chain standards to prevent pellet loss, and eliminating microplastic ingredients in products that might be released into the environment.\n- Eliminating maritime sources and other sector-specific sources of plastic pollution (e.g., agriculture and construction) through policy interventions and incentives that minimize waste and increase collection and recycling rates at end of life.\n\n- We recognize that many forward-thinking businesses and governments are already working in these areas, via several existing initiatives and platforms, and that building on these efforts is crucial. We also know that we need to do more: More businesses and governments at all levels need to join in, and those already on the journey\u2014including plastic producers and converters, consumer goods companies, retailers, and waste management companies\u2014need to continue raising their ambition level. Entrepreneurs, investors, financial institutions, and consumers also play important roles.\n\n- Developing and applying rigorous design and labelling standards that ensure harmonization, elimination of avoidable plastic use, removal of toxic chemicals, achievement of ambitious recycled content targets, and enhanced effectiveness and economics of reuse, refill, and recycling systems.\n- Investing US$50 billion-$100 billion annually in innovation. Deploying all known solutions at the maximum foreseeable scale and pace will not be enough to eliminate plastic pollution by 2040 and will leave significant greenhouse gases being emitted by the sector. Creative solutions are needed throughout the plastic system, supported by governments and the private sector\u2014particularly through increased and new finance streams\u2014and focused primarily on upstream interventions, such as reductions in plastic use, establishment of reuse models, and increased use of sustainable materials.\n- Investing US$550 billion\u2020 in collection and sorting infrastructure over the next 20 years to ensure that all materials are properly managed and recycled. Funding mechanisms such as extended producer responsibility or the equivalent must urgently be put in place globally to provide transparent, stable, and recurri",
