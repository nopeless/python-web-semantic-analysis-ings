  "body": "Hi folks. I am a PCB newbie and am looking for some guidance on integrating panel mount components into a PCB circuit. I understand how through hole components work on a breadboard/stripboard, and how SMD components work on a PCB, but I am a little fuzzy on how panel mount components or through hole components get assembled into a PCB.",
  "readable_content": "- goki (2019-12-08): Yeah SMD would be too fragile for a big 10A+ rocker switch. What you usually want is a panel mount component with the option for \"PC pins\", which has normal sized pins that can fit through a typical PCB.\n\n- datenwolf (2019-12-08): That is, because SMD pads are not meant to be load bearing. As a general rule of thumb: Any component that comes into mechanical contact with a 200 pound gorilla human (switches, connectors) should always be done THT or edge launched. Never use purely SMD attached components for that; at least have the shell mount THT.\n\n- toybuilder (2019-12-08): Be careful about mounting mechanically stressed parts to the PCB if your intention is to mount the PCB and also the parts to the enclosure. When tolerances add up enough, that results in enough of a misalignment that can ultimately stress out the connection at the PCB or at the terminal. Part of what makes panel mount switches reliable is that the mechanical load goes straight to the panel via the body, and not through the electrical terminals.\n\n- edsammy (2019-12-08): You could cut out a big rectangle, snap it in, then attach short jumper wires. Slide switches will be much easier to mount and the surface mount ones are quite strong!\n\n- [deleted] (2019-12-08): I take it you know to treat it as a through hole component, right? Me personally, I'd insert it as I would a resistor, but insert it so that it's flush with the board and solder it on the other side, making sure that the holes would be big enough for the switch leads.\n\n- hineybush (2019-12-08): More often than not panel mount style connectors/switches/etc will have a cable lead from the component in the panel that would plug in/solder to the PCB itself. Also worth doing THT direct to the PCB from the panel, but keep installation/mechanicals in mind if you're planning on having a rigid solution.\n\n- ikkehier (2019-12-08): Suggestion: put something like this: https://www.digikey.com/product-detail/en/te-connectivity-amp-connectors/1217861-1/A100452TR-ND/1148769 on the PCB. Then have wires made (or do it yourself for small quantities) that fit on those and on your switch. The switches you selected are pushed into the front panel from the outside in. The PCB is on the inside of the box. If you want to solder directly it will be very inconvenient to remove/replace the PCB. Recommendation: you will most probably not find a matching footprint, no matter which PCB design tool you use. Learn how to make your own footprints.\n\n- areciboresponse (2019-12-08): I would honestly look into flex PCB for the panel and see if it work for your application. The different depths of panel mount components pose a problem.\n\n- spinwizard69 (2019-12-08): There are all sorts of reasons for different approaches. As for \u201drocker\u201d Switches it depends upon what you expect of it as there are all sorts of SMD switches. For example dip switches can be had in surface mount and made user accessible. I\u2019m pretty sure that I\u2019ve seen larger switches that are surface mount but these usually provide or require supplementary mechanical mounts. The problem is if you need to drill holes for the mechanical restraints you might as well go through hole. In any event for frequently used Panel switches you almost always want them mounted independent of the PCB. The reality is mechanical switches don\u2019t last even with careful users and die quickly when a gorilla operates them. I\u2019m speaking from the perspective of an automation technician here so lighted usage might not see similar failure rates. So repairability is a big thing. Switches soldered into a PCB can lead to premature failure of the board due to frequent repairs. Then you have the structural issues that comes from the required precision to avoid mechanical strain of an installation. This has already been pointed out but it is more involved than simply having the switches on center. This especially if you are using switches with bolted collars to effect some sort of seal at the panel. If this is a product don\u2019t be surprised if a customer does something you didn\u2019t intend. In a number of cases we have pulled a PCB from its housing or the switches for mounting elsewhere. You will design for your imagined use case but that doesn\u2019t mean a customer will not do something different. I hope this helps. Generally you don\u2019t want a device that relies totally upon surface mounting to come into regular user contact. Even through hole components often come with supplemental mechanical restraints because even here you don\u2019t want to be stressing the connection. In an ideal world heavy use switches would be off board.\n\n- nabelekt (2019-12-08): Thank you for all of the responses! When I made the original post, it wasn't clear to me what the \"panel\" in \"panel mount components\" is. Now I understand it to be that the housing or enclosure around the PCB. For this particular project, which I am doing simply as a way to teach myself (and hopefully others) how to take a prototype from an Arduino-based breadboard circuit to a Arduino-independent PCB, I don't intend to create a housing. However, this is all great information for the future. The circuit will have minimal use once I am done, so I am not too worried about failure. What I am gathering is that I probably need a through hole or panel mount with PC pins component that I will have holes drilled for and that I will solder into place.\n\n- rockonrhydon (2019-12-08): When you select your switch, look at the data sheet for the recommended land pattern or pin layout. Check dimensions too, sometimes connectors come with a plastic leg that makes it polarity specific for mounting. Note that most of the switches you provided are not pcb mount switches and are",
