But holy fuck paper straws suck! I just can\u2019t stand the texture of them, the fact they disintegrate in the drink if it\u2019s in too long. We have to draw a line somewhere, and the paper straws is where I draw the line!\n\nEdit: For all you telling me to just buy a reusable straw, where am I going to carry it? In my pockets? I\u2019m a guy, I don\u2019t have a purse.\n\n- redwalk33 (2019-12-08):\nNot unpopular. Paper straws are almost universally hated, except by virtue signalers.\n\n- pongaminbloom (2019-12-08):\nAgreed! Why use a straw can't last long enough for you to drink the soda? Biodegradable, plant-based plastics like George Washington Carver made would be a much better solution for protecting the oceans.\n\n- SiphonerKai (2019-12-08):\nRestaurants should use hay straws.\n\n- YaBoyeChipsAhoy (2019-12-08):\nPlastic straws make up 0.001% of the worlds plastic\n\n- Aminina_ (2019-12-08):\nDude sip your soda without a damn straw then, sea life and all that jazz comes first. Don't like paper straws? Don't use straws. Modern problems old solutions. Or bring your own metal one and stop whining lmao\n\n- ewas86 (2019-12-08):\nWhy can't people just learn to recycle.\n\n- OddlyReal (2019-12-08):\nIt wasn't all that long ago that paper straws (and I mean thin-walled ones!) were the norm.\n\n- Lafayettehamiltion (2019-12-08):\nyes in pockets\n\n- lordhavepercy99 (2019-12-08):\nHonestly most paper straws are crap but one time I was at a pub and I was using straws for 2 hours before I realized that they were paper\n\n- BraveChipmunk3005 (2019-12-08):\nOr better yet: just don\u2019t use straws\n\n- ConfusedLilPumpkin (2019-12-08):\nYou can buy reusable straws...\n\n- FakeJordanBelford (2019-12-08):\nThe world or a mild inconvenience?\n\n- [deleted] (2019-12-08):\nOr....you could just drink from the glass/can/bottle. Outside of physical disability necessitating one, straws in general are dumb.\n\n- slimjimmy613 (2019-12-08):\nI never use straws. I swallow too much air when i use them ill feel like shit.\n\n- SensitiveSnowpea (2019-12-08):\nThis is why I take a reusable silicone straw with me everywhere I go. It\u2019s as close as I can get to a plastic straw without shitting on the environment.\n\n- Loretta1998 (2019-12-08):\nJust don't use a straw then?\n\n- GeneralWaste_69 (2019-12-08):\nCarry it in your pocket, or drink without a straw, it ain't hard. Only times straws are needed are for bubble tea.",
