  "readable_content": "- ImLivingAmongYou (2017-12-08): Plastic Straws Aren\u2019t the Problem\n- young_menace (2017-12-08): Almost every straw campaign has acknowledged that straws aren\u2019t the biggest problem. What they are is a ubiquitous, superfluous item (ignoring the disability arguments) that made people more aware of their plastic consumption but was easy enough for a majority of people to get rid of, as opposed to more expensive, inconvenient alternatives such as reusable cups or safety razors. It\u2019s been very effective at \u201cstarting a conversation\u201d and actually has impacted corporate policy in addition to laws, so this idea of \u201cand/or\u201d in terms of lobbying or individual behaviour is reductive. Changing laws also requires the adaptation of individual consumption behaviours anyway, so the order barely matters.\n  - bjorn_hammerhock_pol (2017-12-08): One solution then is to ban all fishing in the ocean and go vegan.\n  - overlord-oftherings (2017-12-08): Not the biggest problem, but one of the easiest things to fix. A lot of ZW lifestyle changes require huge commitment and dedication compared to what most people are used to. Going without a straw requires no effort and can make a huge cumulative difference.",
