  "readable_content": "IUCN (2023-12-08): The Characterization of Marine Plastics and their Environmental Impacts report highlights the serious problem of plastic debris in the ocean, affecting not only coastal areas of developing countries but also the world's oceans as a whole. Large plastic items generate microplastic particles, which can spread over long distances, impacting marine species and ecosystems. The report emphasizes the lack of precise knowledge about the quantity, sources, transport, accumulation, and fate of plastics in the oceans. It also discusses the adverse effects of marine plastic pollution on marine species, ecosystems, marine biodiversity, and the food web.\n\nTo learn more about the report, visit the [Plastic Debris in the Ocean report](https://www.iucn.org/resources/publications).",
