Other states such as Hawaii, cities such as Seattle and New York, and corporations such as Amazon and Starbucks are also considering or have initiated plastic phase-out plans.\n\nStanford Report\u00a0spoke with\u00a0Jim Leape\n, co-director of the\u00a0Stanford Center for Ocean Solutions\n, and\u00a0Craig Criddle\n, a professor of civil and environmental engineering, about the path to reducing ocean plastic pollution.\n\n[...]\n\n- I found the text informative and thought-provoking. It's interesting to hear different perspectives on the issue of ocean plastic pollution and the potential solutions that are being discussed.",
