  "readable_content": "Interceram - International Ceramic Review (2023-12-08): Researchers from Brazil have found a new application for reusing plastic straws by producing fibers from recycled plastic straws that can be used as additives for refractory materials. These fibers make the drying of refractory products safer and faster, reducing the required time and energy consumption for heating and preventing explosive spalling caused by pressurized water vapor. The recycled fibers have a significantly lower melting point compared to conventional fibers used in this application, making them more efficient in reducing water vapor pressurization. This innovative approach not only addresses the issue of plastic straw waste but also contributes to improving the performance of refractory castables.",
  "summary": "The text highlights an innovative and positive application of reusing plastic straws, demonstrating how they can be repurposed to improve the performance of refractory materials. This approach not only addresses the issue of plastic straw waste but also contributes to enhancing the properties of refractory castables. The sentiment of the text is overwhelmingly positive. \n\nSentiment: 0.9",
