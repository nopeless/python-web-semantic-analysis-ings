The efforts over the last five years have allowed us to make a major step forward. We now know that progress to tackling plastic waste at a global scale is possible, and where the key hurdles are that are preventing further change.\n\n-\u201cBut the world remains far off track from fixing the plastic pollution crisis. The international legally binding instrument on plastic pollution currently being negotiated, alongside accelerated business action, are now needed. We can\u2019t pick or choose from either of these measures \u2013 both are crucial to ensure progress is pushed further and faster.\u201d\n\n-The Foundation \u2013 an international charity developing and promoting the circular economy \u2013 says business signatories have demonstrated that significant progress on tackling plastic waste can be achieved through a collective effort, and as a whole, the rest of industry is lagging behind.\n\n-Sheila Aggarwal-Khan, Director of UNEP\u2019s Industry and Economy Division, welcomed the progress that has been made by signatories of the Global Commitment in the past five years.\n\n-She said: \u201cIn the past five years, the Global Commitment has demonstrated how plastic pollution can be curbed, while shedding light on the \u2018pain points\u2019 that need to be addressed to get the system redesign right.\n\n-\u201cThe ongoing negotiation for an international legally binding instrument is a chance to agree the rules, measures, and incentives for an enabling environment to end plastic pollution. Governments, businesses, and all relevant stakeholders must act with unity to ensure we do not miss this historic opportunity.\u201d\n\n-To bring about global change, industry leaders have key hurdles to overcome around the scaling of reuse business models; tackling flexible packaging waste and pollution, particularly in countries with the highest plastics leakage rates; and the establishment of infrastructure for collection, reuse and recycling, supported by Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) policies.\n\n-The charity highlights the Global Commitment will continue to serve as a key force in driving voluntary action and informing and complementing the international legally binding instrument which will go through a third round of negotiations in Nairobi, Kenya next month (13-19 November).\"",
