  "body": "If you can put speed modules into them then they absorb a lot more pollution though. It works a little backwards, we have these greenhouses from K2 that absorb pollution from atmosphere instead of generating it by 5/m. When you add 2 Eff 1 modules it goes \"up\" to -0.8 absorbed, instead of increasing.",

A developer is only responsible for their built-in modding tools working. The modder is responsible for compatibility between their mod and the game.\n  - escafrost (2022-12-07): Speed modules.\n  - Guava-King (2022-12-07): Throw production modules instead?",
