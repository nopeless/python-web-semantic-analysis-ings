  "readable_content": "user@example.com (2023-12-08): By now, most of us have heard that the use of plastics is a big issue for the environment. Partly fuelled by the success of the BBC\u2019s Blue Planet II series, people are more aware than ever before about the dangers to wildlife caused by plastic pollution \u2013 as well as the impact it can have on human health \u2013 with industries promising money to tackle the issue.\n\nSingle use plastics are now high on the agenda \u2013 with many people trying to do their bit to reduce usage. But what if all of this just provides a convenient distraction from some of the more serious environmental issues? In our new article in the journal Marine Policy we argue plastic pollution \u2013 or more accurately the response of governments and industry to addressing plastic pollution \u2013 provides a \u201cconvenient truth\u201d that distracts from addressing the real environmental threats such as climate change.\n\nYes, we know plastic can entangle birds, fish and marine mammals \u2013 which can starve after filling their stomachs with plastics, and yet there are no conclusive studies on population level effects of plastic pollution. Studies on the toxicity effects, especially to humans are often overplayed. Research shows for example, that plastic is not as great a threat to oceans as climate change or over-fishing.\n\n- The real issue\n  That\u2019s not to say plastic pollution isn\u2019t a problem, rather there are much bigger problems facing the world we live in \u2013 specifically climate change.\n\nIn October last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) produced a report detailing drastic action needed to limit global warming to 1.5\u02daC. Much of the news focused on what individuals could do to reduce their carbon footprint \u2013 although some articles did also indicate the need for collective action.\n\nDespite the importance of this message, environmental news has been dominated by the issues of plastic pollution. So it\u2019s not surprising that so many people think ocean plastics are the most serious environmental threat to the planet. But this is not the case. In 2009 the concept of planetary boundaries was introduced to indicate safe operating limits for the Earth from a number of environmental threats.\n\n- Lifestyle overhaul\n  This is not to distract from the fact that some significant steps have been taken to help the planet environmentally by reducing plastic waste. But it is important not to forget the need for large-scale systemic changes needed internationally to tackle all environmental concerns. This includes longer-term and more effective solutions to the plastic problem \u2013 but also extending to more radical large-scale initiatives to reduce consumption, decarbonise economies and move beyond materialism as the basis for our well-being.\n\n  The focus needs to be on making the way we live more sustainable by questioning our overly consumerist lifestyles that are at the root of major challenges such as climate change, rather than a narrower focus on sustainable consumer choices \u2013 such as buying our takeaway coffee in a reusable cup. We must reform the way we live rather than tweak the choices we make.\n\n  There is a narrow window of opportunity to address the critical challenge of, in particular, climate change. And failure to do so could lead to massive systemic impacts to the Earth\u2019s capacity to support life \u2013 particularly the human race. Now is not the time to be distracted by the convenient truth of plastic pollution, as the relatively minor threats this poses are eclipsed by the global systemic threats of climate change.",
