  "body": "For one, plastic straws are actually quite unnecessary and are usually wasted in high amounts. On the other hand they are quite easily replacable if you really need a straw. Last but not least, bottles are easier to recycle. In germany we have a well working way of handling plastic bottles. You pay a fee of 0.25\u20ac per plastic bottle.",
  "readable_content": "- New_Earthling (2018-12-08): We have banned plastic straws but why are we not banning plastic bottles?\n- eliiscoming (2018-12-08): Good question. Or the plastic lids on the plastic cups the plastic straws go through to drink the liquids that were shipped in plastic containers that all came from crude oil from fracked oil wells that were shipped via plastic coated pipelines. I guess plastic straws were a step lol\n- [deleted] (2018-12-08): I think trying to cut plastic use is good, but you have a point. I was in the grocery store yesterday and I was looking at the products and almost every container is made of plastic or the food is individually wrapped in plastic. Everything. There\u2019s so much plastic. It\u2019s out of control.\n- [deleted] (2018-12-08): anti-litter spin on corporate pollution. Absolutely worth the read but if you\u2019re lazy, the big beverage giants used to collect used glass bottles and clean them to reuse. This worked very well for quite some time but their board of lizard people eventually decided they could cut costs by using single use plastics. This has been one of the worst things to ever happen to the environment and they know it. Instead of taking the blame for this, they preemptively launched an anti-littering ad campaign to stay ahead of \u201cbad publicity\u201d and to reinforce the false concept that it\u2019s the consumers fault for introducing single use plastic into the world.\n- [deleted] (2018-12-08): Because straws are easier to villainize. They are also a lot easier to replace.\n- hmrussell7 (2018-12-08): I think the fact that plastic bottles can be recycled pretty much anywhere that offers recycling has a lot to do with it. If you look at the things being banned right now like straws, styrofoam, and single use plastic bags, they\u2019re not recyclable or have very limited recycled uses. Plus straws are used for relatively short amounts of time so paper/other alternatives don\u2019t have to be as sturdy. Whereas if you are going to have bottled drinks they need to be in something that can hold up. The alternatives I can think of are boxes/cartons or glass bottles. Boxed drink containers aren\u2019t recyclable everywhere and glass poses safety issues and is heavier and therefore more expensive and energy intensive to transport. Obviously we need to cut down on all plastics, and bottles make up a huge part of that. But I think the things we have good alternatives for are being banned first.\n- hannahclara (2018-12-08): And banning the bumping of commercial fishing nets. Try to decrease the amount of ocean fishing in total for an extra bonus\n- jakey_poooh (2018-12-08): Why are we not banning plastic in general\n- BigOlPeps (2018-12-08): Real question is why are balloons still a thing? Bottles are actually useful while balloons... make your birthday colorful?\n- ingachan (2018-12-08): Many European countries have a return system where you pay a small amount for the bottle which you get back when you return it. I can honestly say I have only once thrown a bottle in the trash, when I was about 12, and was then yelled at by my mother. It works really well. In Berlin where I live now it\u2019s common practice to put bottles next to bins outside so homeless people can take it and get the money.\n- Hendrixxxxxx (2018-12-08): Hemp plastic is the best solution to excessive plastic waste. It decays in less than a year and it\u2019s plant based so it\u2019s overall much better for the environment. And for the record, and all political opinions aside, the trump administration did a good thing legalizing hemp, now companies just have to switch to using it hemp plastic.\n- CraftyWeeBuggar (2018-12-08): everything single use should be banned. (excluding medical) we need companies to reevaluate their stocks and stop selling single use crap. offer refillable or bring your own; discounts on using your own to encourage. (refillable/reusable incase you don't have yours with you etc). recycle should be the last resort, they should have long life before recycling into another long life item and so forth.... I mean for everything from toiletries to drinks to food etc , everything should be in a dispenser of sorts. just get the retailer to send back the dispensers to where they got their stocks , along with the pallets they send back up the chain. I mean a 2 way trip! point of origin can sterilize the containers . every return gets a discount or deposit returned etc... this single use crap including all the packaging on everything is just OTT. if they ship in bulk they can reuse bulk packaging , if it needs plastic fresh ? as in actually really needs it, then make strong reusable containers from 100% recycled plastic that can hold the bulk crap between supplier and retailer and send repeatedly back and forth.\n- nostraws (2018-12-08): I am so with you on this. Unless we have legislative changes, we won\u2019t be able to make changes on a massive scale.\n- Opcn (2018-12-08): There was a popular wildlife photo of a sea turtle suffering having gotten a straw in its nose. That\u2019s why we banned straws. The facts didn\u2019t change. The volume of plastic in landfills and ditches has always been huge, but new feelings came out of that photo and that got people to move.\n- [deleted] (2018-12-08): Or any non recyclable plastic\n- kalinafgklsdr (2018-12-08): i\u2019ve noticed more recently than ever before seeing backstage videos and behind the scenes of movies that the cast always have a huge amount of water bottles?? how do they not do like those big filtered containers or glass water jugs and cups or something idk i have been shocked at how much i\u2019m seeing it as of late\n- Agruk (2018-12-08): Since one big reason why we care about straws is to save marine life, why are we not banning the consumption of fish?\n- ingachan (2018-12-08): Because people need food and a lot of people have fish as a big part of their diet. Fishing is also not fundamentally unsustainable. Humans have been fishing for a long time. Industrial, unregulated fishing is a problem, so the consumption of fish in general is not.\n- [deleted] (2018-12-08): Water bottles. Probably the largest plastic environmental hazard currently.\n- starlig-ht (2018-12-08): It is all a distraction. When the masses start asking for real change, they throw us a bone to shut us up. Today we are supposed to worry about straws, while the regulations passed in response to Deep Horizon get revoked.\n",
  "summary": "The discussion revolves around the idea of banning plastic straws and the discrepancies in focusing solely on straws rather than addressing plastic use in general. The conversation touches upon the impact of plastic bottles, the need for viable alternatives, and the concept of reusable packaging. There is a recognition of the need for significant legislative changes to tackle the issue effectively. Overall, the sentiment is critical of the singular focus on plastic straws and advocates for a more comprehensive approach to address plastic use. Sentiment: 0.7",
