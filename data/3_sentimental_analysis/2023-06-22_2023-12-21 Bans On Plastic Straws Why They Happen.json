To combat this increasing problem, countries around the world are now introducing plastic straw bans as part of their many efforts to reduce plastic waste.\n\nBut why are these bans being enforced and where can we find them? Should everywhere and everyone ban plastic straws? Let\u2019s delve a bit deeper into the reasons for these plastic straw bans, and see which countries have already implemented them.\n\n10 Reasons Why Plastic Straws Should Be Banned\n\nPlastic straws have become commonplace within many restaurants, caf\u00e9s, and fast-food chains \u2014 but their convenience is being debated and their use is controversial. As environmental awareness increases, governments are taking action to proudly reduce plastic consumption; banning plastic straws in various countries and regions.\u00a0\n\nThe convenience of plastic straws is something that cannot be denied. They prove to be lightweight, inexpensive and can be disposed of easily. However, these positives must be weighed against the unignorable negatives: single-use plastics, like these straws, contribute to pollution and clutter our oceans with non-biodegradable trash. This is one of the many reasons many countries are enforcing strict laws that either ban the use of plastic straws or charge fees for their use.\u00a0\n\nThese bans represent a giant leap toward reducing society\u2019s reliance on disposable plastics \u2014 further driving the point that convenience isn't always worth the cost to our environment. Here are 10 reasons why the plastic straw ban is common in many areas:\u00a0\n\n- Plastic straws wreak havoc on the environment and wildlife. The majority of discarded plastics end up in oceans where they can be mistaken as food by turtles and other marine life, causing them severe harm or even tragic death.\n- Plastic straws are not biodegradable. They do take hundreds of years to break down into smaller pieces, eventually becoming microplastics that can then dangerously enter our food chain through contaminated seafood or water sources.\u00a0 To save the environment, consciously use compostable straws made from plant-based materials instead!\n- Plastic straws frequently find their way into oceans and other water sources. Plastic can cause serious harm to marine life when ingested or stuck in their digestive systems. This is a root cause of why these plastic straw bans are so important - they help keep our waterways clean and safe for wildlife.\n- The production of plastic straws requires extreme amounts of energy and resources, as well as the toxic chemicals it releases into the atmosphere. These toxins can cause serious health problems, such as cancer and respiratory illnesses, in humans, animals, and the environment at large. If you adapt to using straws made from natural, eco-friendly materials instead, this life-changing issue can cease to occur.\n- Plastic straws are rarely recycled or reused correctly. They are difficult to recycle due to their size, shape, and material composition. Most frequently, straws become litter and eventually find their way into rivers and oceans, endangering unwitting marine life.\n- Plastic straws are fragile and easily carried away by the wind. This increases the chances that they will travel after use and end up in waterways or on open beaches, where they can be swallowed by wildlife such as birds or fish.\n- By 2050, it is estimated that more plastic will be in the ocean than fish by weight. The water contains approximately 450,000 tons of plastic, while about 4.5 million pounds end up in the sea annually.\n- Among the 10 items that pollute beaches, the main culprit at large are plastic straws. They harm seabirds, turtles, and other wildlife. Let's move toward a new direction away from thoughtlessly polluting our environment, and start to use sustainable straws instead..\n- Single-use plastic straws generate huge amounts of surplus waste - an estimated 500 million plastic straws are used each day in the US alone!\n- Plastic straws are harmful to human health. Toxic chemicals that leach from plastic drinking straws are known to be found in human blood and tissues. These substances are connected with cancer, obesity, birth defects, weakened immune systems, and endocrine disruption, among many others.\n\nWhat States Have Banned Plastic Straws in the US?\n\nPlastic straws are among the most common disposable items found in restaurants and eateries all over the United States. To reduce plastic waste, some states have taken the initiative to issue plastic straw bans in order to protect our environment.\u00a0\n\nCalifornia Became the First State To Take Actions\n\nCalifornia was the first state in the United States to take action on this issue, passing the legislation that prohibits dine-in restaurants from providing customers with single-use plastic straws; unless requested by a customer.\u00a0\n\nThis law came into effect on January 1st, 2019. California has also proposed additional legislation that will expand its regulations on single-use plastics and packaging, and promote alternatives including compostable materials or reusable packaging.\n\nSource: Internet\n\nOregon, New York, Washington DC, Colorado and Other States\n\nFollowing California\u2019s decision, several states have since implemented a plastic straw ban. Oregon, New York, Washington DC, and Colorado are among the states leading the charge against single-use plastics.\u00a0\n\nOregon passed a statewide ban on single-use plastic straws in 2019. Since then, more than 20 cities and counties within Oregon have adopted similar restrictions.\u00a0\n\nIn 2020, New York became one of the first East Coast states to ban plastic straws from restaurants and other food service establishments.\u00a0\n\nThis was then followed up by Washington DC & Colorado passing their own ordinance that would prohibit restaurants from providing disposable plastic drinking straws, as well as stirrers and cocktail picks made of plastic or paper products. Instead, these states firmly encourage the use of compostable materials or reusable products.\n\nSource: Internet\n\nPlastic Straws Ban in Europe\n\nPlastic straws have become the latest target of European governments as part of their efforts to reduce plastic waste. On 3 July 2021, a ban on single-use plastic straws came into effect in the European Union. Plastic plates, cutlery, straws, balloon sticks, and cotton buds cannot be introduced in the marketplaces of the member countries in the EU.\n\nThe EU law bans both the sale and distribution of plastic straws and other single-use plastics, such as cutlery, stirrers, plates, and cotton buds. However, this ban does not apply to people with disabilities who need drinking aids or flexible materials like paper or biodegradable plastics.\n\nAs well as banning single-use plastics, several European countries have implemented taxes on non-biodegradable materials such as polystyrene foam and rigid PVC packaging. These measures are aimed at reducing the amount of plastic entering our oceans and landfills in an effort to protect wildlife habitats and prevent further pollution.\n\nSource: Internet",
