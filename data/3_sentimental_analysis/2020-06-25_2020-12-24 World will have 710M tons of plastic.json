  "readable_content": "- CNN (2023-12-08): The study, from a group of international researchers and published in the journal Science on Thursday, found that even in a \u201cbest-case scenario\u201d where the amount of plastic pollution was reduced by 80% by 2040, there would still be a massive build-up of accumulated plastic.\n\n- The team found that seriously ramped up global efforts could cut plastic pollution by 40% from 2016 levels, or 78% relative to a \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d model by 2040.\n\n- Dr. James Palardy, co-author of the report and Director of Pew\u2019s Conservation Science Program, said the true cost plastic pollution has on human health and the environment \u2013 and of doing nothing to reduce it \u2013 is largely unknown, but waiting to find out how it affects us is not the answer.\n\n- The team set out to figure solutions for solving plastic pollution. They created a model that mapped out the entire global plastic system \u2013 from production to waste \u2013 and developed five scenarios to estimate reductions in plastic pollution between 2016 and 2040.\n\n- They found that there is no silver bullet solution to reducing global plastic pollution. Instead, change is needed across the whole supply chain.\n\n- The team noted that in many middle-income countries, such as India, informal workers and waste pickers made a living from collecting plastics and that their work was a key component of being able to solve the collection gap.\n\n- The team\u2019s findings come as waste from Covid-19 \u2013 discarded PPE, masks, gloves, hand sanitizer bottles and take-out boxes \u2013 has ended up in landfills or our oceans.\n\n- One of the biggest challenges to changing our plastic habits is helping people to connect the dots between the plastics they consume and the pollution on our beaches and seas.\n\n- \"Beach clean ups are going and mopping up the floor while the tap is still on. As good as they are, you need to turn off the source,\" said Gary Stokes, director of operations at OceansAsia.",
