  "readable_content": "UNEP (2023-12-08): The briefing paper \"Biodegradable Plastics and Marine Litter: Misconceptions, concerns and impacts on marine environments\" explores the key issues surrounding the biodegradability of plastics in the oceans. It questions whether the adoption of biodegradable plastics will reduce the overall impact of marine plastics and addresses the lack of public knowledge about such plastics. Additionally, it raises concerns over the labeling of products as \"biodegradable,\" suggesting that it may lead to more littering behaviors due to a perceived technical fix that removes responsibility from individuals.",
  "summary": "The briefing paper raises concerns about the effectiveness of biodegradable plastics in reducing marine litter and highlights the potential negative impact of labeling products as \"biodegradable.\" It suggests that such labeling may lead to increased littering behaviors. Overall, the tone of the text is cautious and raises important questions about the real impact of biodegradable plastics on marine environments.\n\nSentiment: 0.5",
