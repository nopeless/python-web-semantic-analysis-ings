  "readable_content": "- savyb_ (2023-12-08): Hi! I asked this question in r/environment and someone referred me here. Please let me know if my question could receive better answers somewhere else, or if it has been answered already! :-)\n  \n  I am an avid drinking straw lover, but I am an environment lover more. I am making the switch to reusable straws, but I have a whole package of unused plastic straws in my kitchen.\n\n  What is the best way to get rid of them? I don\u2019t want to just throw them away because obviously that\u2019s not helping the cause but is that the only option I have? Kind of a \u201cthese are the last straws I\u2019ll ever throw away so whatever\u201d type deal? Or is there a better way to get rid of them?\n\n  Also, I\u2019m not interested in repurposing them for DIY stuff. There\u2019s too many of them and frankly, I just don\u2019t have the time/energy to repurpose them. Plus they\u2019ll just get thrown away eventually.\n\n  Thanks in advance for any advice!!\n\n- [deleted] (2023-12-08): If you already have them, I say just use them, or just tuck them away for emergencies, like if you have a party and 20 guests need straws and you don't have enough reusables. Just make sure they are disposed of properly.\n\n- [deleted] (2023-12-08): That depends on your city's waste management system.
