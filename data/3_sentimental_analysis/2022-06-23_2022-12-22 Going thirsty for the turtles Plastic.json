The aim of this paper is to explore the competing demands of saving the world\u2019s oceans and sea life from plastic straw waste, and simultaneously meeting the health and social needs of people with swallowing or physical disability who use plastic straws for drinking.\n\nResult\n\nIn order to meet both SDG 14 and not compromise SDG 3 there is a need for collaborative and interdisciplinary, person-centred, inclusive innovation approaches to finding suitable and acceptable alternatives to plastic straws. Many people with swallowing disability will need a durable, flexible, and single-use straw that is resilient enough to withstand jaw closure without breaking. Co-design considerations include the alternative straw being (a) soft and flexible so as not to damage the teeth of people who bite to stabilise the jaw or who have a bite reflex; (b) suitable for both hot and cold drinks; (c) flexible for angling to the mouth; (d) readily, thoroughly and easily cleaned to a high standard of hygiene; (e) widely available for low or no cost wherever drinks are served; and (f) safe for people to use while reducing impact on the environment and being sustainable.\n\nConclusion\n\nPlastic straws are an assistive technology critical for the social inclusion of people with disability. In an inclusive society, reaching a policy position on the provision of plastic straws must include seeking out and listening to the voices of people with sensory, intellectual, physical, or multiple disabilities who use plastic straws.\n\nKeywords: \n\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs)sustainabilitylife below water (SDG 14)good health and wellbeing (SDG 3)SDG 3 plastic strawsdysphagiadisability\n- Plastic straws and the world\u2019s marine life\n  ...\n- The need for straws with specific characteristics\n  ...\n- Straw bans as a form of eco-ableism, shallow environmentalism, and discrimination\n  ...\n\n- Meeting SDG 14 should not form a barrier to achieving SDG 3, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. Straw bans are problematic in risking the health and well-being of people with disability, and alternative straws are not innocuous in terms of impacts on the environment. There is emerging a greater understanding of the multidimensional environmental, economic, and social impacts of various types of straws (Roy et\u00a0al., \nCitation\n2021), including those made of cardboard, glass, metal, wood, bamboo, or pasta. Given that all straws have specific environmental and human impacts, a",
