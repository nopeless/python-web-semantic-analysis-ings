  "body": "getawhiffofgriff \u2022 2 yr. ago. I'm about one of the few rare people who drinks things quick enough to not have to deal with soggy paper straws. For me an ice cap is a 5 minute confection. If I don't have water first it's probably a 2 minute slug. With that said - the Tims paper straws feel so robust and thick in the wrapper.",
  "readable_content": "- 1clkgtramg (2020-12-08): Whoever said these paper straws are \u201cgreat\u201d must suck back Iced Capps in 15 min.\n\n- epsileth (2020-12-08): Reusable stainless steel or silicone bubble tea/smoothie straw?\n\n- baconpoutine89 (2020-12-08): This. Costco has a nice set of stainless steel straws for like $6.99 that come with a cleaning kit and a travel pouch.\n\n- 1clkgtramg (2020-12-08): It\u2019s looking more and more like I\u2019m gonna have to invest in those. I have a few Timmies and Starbucks straws left but I know I\u2019m gonna have to purchase something long term.\n\n- getawhiffofgriff (2020-12-08): I\u2019m about one of the few rare people who drinks things quick enough to not have to deal with soggy paper straws. For me an ice cap is a 5 minute confection. If I don\u2019t have water first it\u2019s probably a 2 minute slug.\n\n- 1clkgtramg (2020-12-08): I was shocked it didn\u2019t last. When I took it out it was the sturdiest paper straw I\u2019ve seen. It might as well be wooden. It mixed very well and it was a wider hole than the red ones (if that\u2019s good or bad is up to you). I decided to leave it in since I\u2019ve seen people say it will last but unfortunately it wasn\u2019t the case. It still died just like the smaller straws at A&W do. It\u2019s a shame; I don\u2019t care what the straw is made of, it just has to work with what I\u2019m drinking. But iced capps need to constantly be stirred if you are taking your time with it so a straw that can\u2019t handle that for a few hours is gonna be a struggle for me.\n\n- BestJoeyEver1 (2020-12-08): To be fair, the whole point is that it dissolves. People shouldn't expect them to behave exactly like plastic.\n\n- Anonymous-1234567890 (2020-12-08): I absolutely hate the paper straws. I support the reasoning, just hate them in general. I have my own straws I bring out now, some even stay in my car!\n\n- Canadianmade840 (2020-12-08): Honestly the biggest problem here with me was that 10 years ago strip deforestation and over-mining was gonna end us.. now it\u2019s plastic, so we\u2019re back to using paper, and more. We\u2019re literally playing pong between two huge issues trying to balance it by doing shit like this.\n\n- Shayde505 (2020-12-08): Fuckin hate paper straws. I tend to enjoy my drinks slowly but surely and other places that have implemented them have show me if you don't pound your beverage back like a shot of whiskey you end up with a pulpy mess in your drink which is oddly enough the exact opposite if what I want in a liquid I plan to consume with the sole exception of oj\n\n- 1clkgtramg (2020-12-08): So I finally got the paper straw; left it in my iced Capp for an hour, came back to it and it\u2019s lost all structure. Bent on the slightest stir and I can\u2019t suck it cause I guess ice is stuck? Lol. Considering there\u2019s not a whole lot of iced drinks at Timmies, I\u2019m not sure the point. These don\u2019t last long contrary to what some people have been saying here.\n\n- BoyFromTO (2020-12-08): This! I've asked guests what they think about the new straws, and the majority dislike them. They got rid of the plastic straws yet everything still comes packaged in plastic.\n\n- Homie_F (2020-12-08): Man I hate these paper straws. Environment > practicality? Surely their sales are going down with how annoying it is to drink with these straws, along with how weird it feels to be put it on your lips. I don't even feel like buying reusable straws tho, cuz these paper ones make me buy less iced capps which is honestly good health wise. But on the rare occasion when I feel like getting one, these straws really ruin the experience.\n\n- st4rsin (2020-12-08): That's pretty much how I deal with it. If they serve paper straws for my drink, I just avoid it next time I order. It's a nuisance to carry around reusable straws, and metal ones not only change the flavor, but hurt when you hut a bump in the road and they jam on your gum or tooth. No fast food joint is better than the other, it's all garbage food anyway, so I'll always go to the one with the plastic straws. I'm all for helping the environment out, but man, paper in liquid... who was the genius that thought up this concept and who is the moron that bought into it like it's a good idea?\n\n- mlipintime (2020-12-08): I wish the straws has some sort of reinforcement, even a natural wax coating to keep moisture out of the paper fibers? Idk i know the government forcing the elimination of single use plastics so they can't go back to plastic.",
