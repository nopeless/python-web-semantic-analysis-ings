  "readable_content": "Joe Scaglione (2021-11-22): The Invention of Plastic Straws\n\nIf you wanted a straw in the 1880s, you\u2019d have to settle for ryegrass.\nRyegrass straws didn\u2019t make for the best drinking experience.\n\nThe Original Paper Straw...\n- Marvin Stone hated the gritty residue ryegrass straws left as they broke down in his Mint Juleps.\n- Triggered and bored, Stone made his own drinking device.\n- He wrapped strips of paper around a pencil, then removed the pencil and glued the strips together, birthing the modern paper straw.\n\nThe Bendy Paper Straw...\n- 40 years later, while sitting in agony watching his daughter struggle to drink her milkshake through a straight drinking straw, Joseph B. Friedman decided to take action.\n- He jammed a screw into the straight straw, wrapped dental floss around the ridges, and removed the screw.\n- This transformed the straight straw into a bendy straw, saving millions from the struggle of awkwardly consuming blended beverages.\n\nThings Get Krazy...\n- In the 1960s, things got krazy with straws.\n- Paper straws died off due to the durable drinking experience plastic straws offered.\n- The plastic era gave birth to new inventions such as the Krazy Straw.\n\nEat Your Straw...\n- The Magic Straw contained flavour beads which dissolved in liquid, creating either a chocolate, strawberry, or banana cream-flavour.\n- Kellogg\u2019s introduced a line of cereal straws in 2007.\n\nBack To The Future of Straws...\n- However, with people realizing the world now matters, paper straws are making a comeback.\n- Aardvark Paper Drinking Straws designed a modern age paper straw, which is a combination of paper and glue to increase the straw\u2019s durability in liquid, and allow straws to break down in landfills.",
