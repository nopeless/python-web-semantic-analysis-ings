  "readable_content": "- MDMagicMark (2023-12-08): The argument about sea turtles and plastic straws is so dumb, paper straws are not any better for the environment. It\u2019s a ploy. Corporate waste and commercial fishing makes up for 95% of the trash in the ocean. Plastic straws .002%. Paper straws are terrible to use and there are new studies showing that they are actually harmful. Use a plastic straw that doesn\u2019t crumble in 5 minutes. Silicone straws are fine, metal straws are fine. But if you are a crusader for paper straws I probably think you\u2019re an idiot and fall for corporate propaganda so easily. TLDR: paper straws are ass, and you\u2019re not a bad person for using plastic, despite what uninformed activists say\n\n- AutoModerator (2023-12-08): Moderator Announcement Read More \u00bb\n\n- mellow_squid (2023-12-08): They decompose and plastic doesn't \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\n\n- Working_Horse_3077 (2023-12-08): Metal straw. Durable washable and reusable. Just because it's insignificant in the whole scheme of things doesn't mean it isn't a significant improvement. Getting rid of plastic straws would be a whopping 8.3 billion less objects that don't decompose per year.\n\n- FlyParticular8172 (2023-12-08): So do like plastic or paper because I sell both. I'll agree with whatever point you make as long as you buy my straws. What environment?\n\n- Ok_Force_2190 (2023-12-08): Fuck it, uranium straws. Why not?\n\n- MDMagicMark (2023-12-08): Hell yeah\n\n- Chaotic_Boots (2023-12-08): I don't even know why we bother recycling paper. It is worse for the environment to recycle paper than it is to just let it decompose. The logging industry plants a shit load of trees to make sure they don't have a \"lorax\" situation where they run out of product to sell. Plastic is a wonder material that can do basically anything but it's terrible as far as a waste product, takes forever to decompose and gets into everything. But plastic straws are a negligible part of plastic use in the world. There are so many better options to reduce plastic use.\n\n- TheUnhollyGoblin (2023-12-08): I don't think we should have any straws because I'm actually able to put my lips to the cup like an adult\n\n- doc_shades (2023-12-08): aren't paper straws compostable? they will break down and \"fucking crumble\", unlike a plastic straw which will be a plastic straw for hundreds? thousands? or years.",
