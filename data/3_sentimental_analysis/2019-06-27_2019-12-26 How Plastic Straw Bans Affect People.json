  "readable_content": "CreakyJoints (2019-10-28): Plastic Straw Bans Are Not Fair to People with Disabilities, and Here\u2019s What We Can Do About It\n\nUnless you\u2019re in the teeny tiny minority of the population that never uses straws to drink beverages, chances are you\u2019ve heard something about the growing trend of bans or restrictions on the use of plastic straws and other single-use plastic items.\n\n- Many people have mixed feelings about these bans, but one voice that\u2019s getting left out of the conversation about the plastic straw ban is that of people with disabilities. Plastic straws are essential for many individuals with disabilities to consume food and beverages for hydration and nutrition, as well as to participate in social and recreational activities.\n\n- Plastic flexible straws were initially used in hospitals to help patients who were reclining in bed drink more easily. They were first utilized by people with disabilities before they became mainstream utensils.\n\n- Many disabilities that necessitate the use of straws are invisible, and requiring customers to explicitly request a plastic straw may force those with disabilities to explain their needs in a way that adds unnecessary roadblocks to everyday activities.\n\n- Alternatives to plastic straws present various challenges for individuals with disabilities, such as falling apart quickly, being inflexible, or posing safety risks. Additionally, these alternatives can be made with ingredients that contain major allergens and may create unintended consequences.\n\n- People with disabilities also care about the environment, but often find themselves on the wrong side of the battle to save the environment due to their unique needs that aren\u2019t 100 percent environmentally friendly.\n\nThis article highlights the impact of plastic straw bans on people with disabilities and advocates for a more inclusive approach to environmental policies.",
