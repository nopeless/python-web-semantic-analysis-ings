  "readable_content": "- **National Geographic** (2023-12-08): Nearly Every Seabird on Earth Is Eating Plastic\n  - A new study reveals that 90 percent of seabirds eat plastic, and virtually every one will be consuming it by 2050. The rate of plastic ingestion is growing steadily due to the increasing global production of plastics. Plastic found inside birds includes bags, bottle caps, synthetic fibers from clothing, and tiny rice-sized bits. The health effects of plastics on seabird populations have not been fully measured, but observational data collected is troubling enough to indicate the threats they face. The study also found a 67 percent decline in seabird populations between 1950 and 2010.",
  "summary": "The post from National Geographic highlights the alarming issue of seabirds consuming plastic, indicating the devastating impact of plastic pollution on marine life. The findings suggest a need for urgent action to address the growing problem of plastic ingestion by seabirds.
