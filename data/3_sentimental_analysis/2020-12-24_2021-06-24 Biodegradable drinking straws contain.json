But an analysis of drinking straws available in the US detected 21 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)\u2014called \u201cforever chemicals\u201d for their extreme resistance to environmental breakdown\u2014in 36 out of 38 brands of plant-based straws tested.\n\nUniversity of Florida toxicologist John Bowden was fascinated by the durability of today\u2019s paper straws compared with older ones that would break down quickly in a drink, and he wanted to know whether the new straws\u2019 water resistance might come from PFAS (Chemosphere 2021, DOI: 10.1016/j.chemosphere.2021.130238). So he and his colleagues tested them, as well as plant-based straws made of materials including poly(lactic acid), rice flour, and reeds. They extracted PFAS from the straws with methanol and measured PFAS levels in the extracts.\n\nIn the US, companies have voluntarily phased out two PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Yet PFOA and PFOS were common in the straws.\n\nThis finding \"signifies either ongoing use or contamination that continues decades after use has ended,\" David Andrews of the Environmental Working Group, an advocacy organization, writes in an email. Drinking straws and food packaging, in which Andrews and others have detected the substances, are \"textbook examples of nonessential uses\" of PFAS, he says.\n\nBowden\u2019s team tested a straw with high levels of the PFAS to determine whether the substances would leach out of the straws into water at temperatures typical of beverages and landfills. About two-thirds of extractable PFAS leached out at all temperatures tested. Bowden says this means that sipping your drink through a plant-based straw is a potential route of PFAS exposure. Small exposures add up: PFAS break down very slowly in the body, he says.\"\n\n- This is a concerning discovery as it highlights the presence of PFAS in \"biodegradable\" drinking straws, suggesting potential health risks associated with these plant-based alternatives to plastic.",
  "summary": "The discovery of PFAS in \"biodegradable\" drinking straws raises concerns about potential health risks associated with these plant-based alternatives to plastic. It underscores the importance of thoroughly evaluating the environmental and health impacts of alternative materials before promoting them as eco-friendly solutions. Sentiment: -0.9",
