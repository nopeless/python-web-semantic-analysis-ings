That\u2019s when chef-owner Lisa Ahier looks over and says, \u201cThere\u2019s no straws in Tofino any more, because of the litter.\u201d \u00a0Ah. That explains it. \u00a0On March 1, the town of Tofino began a campaign called \u201cStraws Suck\u201d with the intention of getting all local businesses to ban plastic straws by Earth Day, April 22. A couple of days before the deadline, all but three businesses were on board, and even the stragglers were well on their way to complying in time.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re almost at 100 per cent completion,\u201d says Michelle Hall, co-chair of the Pacific Rim chapter of Surfrider Foundation, the environmental group spearheading the campaign, which is now expanding to other communities, including Vancouver. \u201cI\u2019m totally confident we\u2019ll have everybody. It\u2019s pretty cool.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s not cool is the amount of non-biodegradable garbage caused by plastic straws each year. Straws are a significant part of the 20 million tonnes of single-use plastics that end up in the ocean each year, according to Surfrider. They are not just unsightly; they are a hazard to sea life, and worse, they introduce toxins into the food chain.\n\nThe question is, why do we need straws anyway? And how did we get to the point where our planet is choking to death on them?\n\nAdmittedly, there are some occasions where a straw is a good idea. Dentists love them because they prevent acidic drinks from coming in contact with tooth enamel, thereby reducing tooth decay. And they\u2019re certainly a good idea if you\u2019re uncertain about the cleanliness of your drinking vessel.\n\nMostly, thought, straws make it easier to enjoy thick, rich, heavily textured drinks like smoothies, slushies, milkshakes, bubble tea and cocktails such as juleps and Mai Tais.\n\n- ...\n- ...",
