  "readable_content": "- KappaSigma1 (2023-12-08): Paranoid about a plastic straw [Florida]\n  \nI lost a small 2-inch plastic straw somewhere in my car. I cleaned and vacuumed the inside of my car but couldn't find it, it's under the seats somewhere. On the slight chance that a police officer searches my vehicle and finds it, would a microscopic amount of cocaine residue be enough to get someone in trouble?\n\n- A_Criminal_Lawyer (2023-12-08): In Florida, possession of cocaine, in any amount, is a felony. The straw itself can also be considered paraphernalia which is a misdemeanor. Typical clients with those charges don't walk away without at least a few months of jail time. I suggest quitting the habit since it eventually catches up to you in the form of handcuffs and a jail cell. If you have an addiction, please seek rehab.\n\n- litmustest1 (2023-12-08): Yes\n\n- hortonhoo (2023-12-08): Find that straw and get rid of it. If discovered by an officer, you could definitely face charges for possession of drug paraphernalia.\n\n- mbz321 (2023-12-08): LOL",
