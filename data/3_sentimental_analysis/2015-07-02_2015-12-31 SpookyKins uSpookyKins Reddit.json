  "readable_content": "- SpookyKins (u/SpookyKins) - Reddit\n  - Lewd but well-drewed (I will mangle English to make this title work) \n    - 5 yr. ago\n    - This is an older thread so I dont think many people will see this comment, but I have a good deal of breast to work with, and if i hunch my shoulders a bit and and squeeze my arms in a bit tighter to really oomf up my cleavage, then guess what, my nipples shift. They're not where they would normally be, they're in a slightly different position than if I wasn't slightly altering my stance. Same if I'm lying down or pulling my arms back, then the nipple is further from the other. I can go crazy and make them touch even, although at that point it's really fucking obvious to what I'm doing hahaha. My point is, this nipple location isn't entirely unrealistic. She does look like she's holding her arms too close to her body, and her shoulders are slightly hunched and she's facing slightly sideways, so her nipple can be pushed up and closer to her other boob, so unlike the majority of people in this comment section, I have no qualms with where I \"think\" her nipple should be. I do however think that's probably all unintentional, as there's so much else wrong with the design of this lady that I don't really think that much thought went into this lol.\n  - Lady interrupts me when I try to tell her what's wrong with her drink order, so she gets what she asked for.\n    - SpookyKins replied to TheRealNobodySpecial 5 yr. ago\n      - How could you possibly be with that knowledge? Hrnggg\n  - A weird thing but does anyone remember when strawberries at the store came in these green plastic baskets?\n    - 5 yr. ago\n    - SpookyKins commented\n      - I see them every year for the local, farm field strawberries. Strawberries from further away or out of season (and grown in green houses) are packed in the clear clamshell packages. Remind me in the summer and I'll send you pics to help with your nostalgia haha\n  - Help with a double vlookup option - or other option\n    - SpookyKins replied to TheFirstKevlarhead 5 yr. ago\n      - SOLUTION VERIFIED\n    - SpookyKins replied to SpookyKins 5 yr. ago\n      - wait i'm retarded.... it just needed to be TRUE\n    - SpookyKins replied to BringBackTheOldFrog 5 yr. ago\n      - When I'm doing the vlookup I base it on whatever date - so for example Feb 1/19. Then a vlookup will bring me to the amount where Feb 1, 2019 falls. But I was looking to see if there was a way to specifically search for \"IG\" and then find Feb 1/19 and return the number in column C.\n    - SpookyKins replied to TheFirstKevlarhead 5 yr. ago\n      - you have assumed all as correct. Formula returns N/A\n    - 5 yr. ago\n      - Hello Hello! I have this incredibly complicated spreadsheet - that's only complicated because I had no idea what I was doing back in the day, so it has a bunch of nested min, max, if, sumifs, etc etc all over the place because I didn't really know what I was doing. So as it turns out, vlookup SORT OF does the job I need it to do, however I need it to look up 2 things instead of 1. Data: A B C IG 1/1/17 1000 IG 1/1/19 1100 IG 1/1/23 1200 IM 10/1/16 500 IM 10/1/20 600 IR 5/1/18 800 G H IG 2/1/19 So currently I have a mess of a worksheet, that does work mind you. But it's not clean, and takes some time to sort out if anything goes a bit haywire. I learned I can do vlookup for the date if I give IG their own table, IM their own table, and IR their own table, etc etc. approximate match. But I was wondering if there was a way just to keep it all in the same table (like above) and have something do an approximate match lookup for the date, based on the name (IG/IM/IR/)? Hope you can help <3 *Edited for more clarity\n  - Encountered one on reddit - I received platinum a while back and it came with 700 complimentary reddit coins, so I\u2019ve been giving silver to posts/comments that I enjoyed. Apparently it\u2019s not enough. Should\u2019ve probably purchased more RC\u2019s from my money to give them gold MINIMUM.\n    - 5 yr. ago\n    - SpookyKins commented\n      - What does silver do?

This might be an easy one for you guys, but I'm looking at help with the following: E12 has he following =IF(OR(T12=MONTH(3),T12=MONTH(6),T12=MONTH(9),T12=MONTH(12)),\"TRUE\",\"FALSE\") T12 =TODAY() It returns true no matter what month today falls in. I'm hoping someone can direct me on how to fix this, I don't want to add another column just to make T12 equal 1/2/3/etc Thanks :)\n  - For those with office jobs, what little touches have you added to make your desk a little more pleasant?\n    - 5 yr. ago\n    - SpookyKins commented\n      - Everything on my desk is functional for work. Post it note holder, pen holder, tape dispenser, stapler, etc etc. They do however all happen to be cat shaped.
