  "body": "Basically, you don't get a plastic bag, straw, or whatever automatically. This has been shown to reduce marine debris. We also have a program where people in the fishing industry get paid to convert broken nets into trash collection bags for boaters. This has incentivized collecting and keeping old nets.",
  "readable_content": "- JaxZeus (2021-12-08): One of my meds needs to be injected by needles and I hate how much plastic there is in the packaging but I understand that this is one of the cases when single use is important.\n- Renny-or-not (2021-12-08): I hope that there can be advancement in sterilization of medical equipment that can reduce our plastic use but I get it, it does suck though\n- ellamoosella (2021-12-08): As a person who needs medical syringes, this seems obvious\n- idk_whatever_69 (2021-12-08): We're just anyone who takes medicine of any kind... Even acetaminophen for your headache. And if someone is trying to tell you to give up your medicine then run, they're part of a cult.\n- Gloomy_Magician_536 (2021-12-08): Just another example of how companies are putting their responsibilities upon us. Straws are not even the most contaminant plastic in the world.\n- mhoIulius (2021-12-08): Isn\u2019t vast majority of plastic in the oceans fishing nets? Straws are the least of our worries.\n- KarmaPharmacy (2021-12-08): I have neurological issues, but I look perfectly normal. I spill a lot of things, bump onto a lot of things, and sometimes drinking out of a cup with no straw is a little challenging. I feel like a jerk when I ask for a straw, but it really helps me drink with ease.\n- the_limerence (2021-12-08): Thank you for posting this. My partner is disabled (also neurological issues) and cannot drink straight from a cup for the same reasons. She has taken to carrying them in her purse.\n- Eagleeye412 (2021-12-08): Amazon: Order your steel straw to save the planet and we'll pack it into 3 boxes, with a literal pound of bubble plastic, and ship it over 300 miles of logistical nonsense.\n- LizJru (2021-12-08): Totally Agree, don't know why you're facing so much backlash. If you don't NEED them, don't use them. If you DO, don't let others opinions of you turn you off, get what you need and tell em to suck it.\n- SecondEngineer (2021-12-08): A lot of people forget that one of the biggest reasons for saving the earth is so that we can live on it.\n- idk_whatever_69 (2021-12-08): But we're not saving the Earth, the Earth's totally fine It don't care. We're trying to save ourselves.\n- heyitscory (2021-12-08): Sandwich cutters aren't meant to be single use. Nobody is buying them for single use. It's a dumb kitchen gadget, but so is a flat whisk. If someone finds use for the tool, good for them! That's not the same as being disposable and I'm not sure how this is getting lumped in with straws, but since straws are being unfairly scapegoated, I guess it makes sense they're in the same conversation?\n- Renny-or-not (2021-12-08): There was a post about plastic sandwich cutters being for \u201clazy people\u201d and completely disregarding it\u2019s use as an accessibility device that is what that is in reference to\n- bromeleon (2021-12-08): Flat whisks are for making a roux which is a common thing to make for many recipes. I'd rather not fling napalm around with a round whisk so I consider a flat whisk a kitchen staple, not a dumb kitchen gadget.\n- xmonetsdirtybeardx (2021-12-08): I know I\u2019m going to get downvoted but I don\u2019t care. This is such a WTF argument. No one is disputing plastic instruments for people who have medical disabilities and need them. People are on here to express their mutual disbelief in the literal TONS of wasteful plastic in the world and you\u2019re inserting this argument to be contrarian or you work for some PR plastics firm. Show me the actual numbers, real facts, as to how many people need plastics and we can continue this narrative. As for the guy who says this thread is toxic I also disagree. I enjoy my daily involvement with people on here who are also baffled by how much waste there is in the world and strive to do better. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s toxic at all. It\u2019s reaffirming actually.\n- [deleted] (2021-12-08): I\u2019d imagine the people that need single use plastics are less than 1% of the population. Not sure what this has to do with anti-consumption\n- Renny-or-not (2021-12-08): There are 51.2 million disabled people making up roughly 18% of the population. Each of those people have different accessibility needs which can (and late get does mean) using single use plastic items. People on this subreddit seem to have the idea that there is no reason for people to use single use plastic but that simply isn\u2019t the case.\n- Haja024 (2021-12-08): syringes, condom wrappers, Covid-19 antigen testing kits, packaging of snacks that can get messy (such as chocolate). All of these have an alternative (glass, alufoil, nothing and alufoil, respectively), but they have durability issues, the risk of contamination is too high, or the single-use plastics recycling is more economical because metal recycling is unavailable somewhere. And if you forget your canvas bag, plastic causes less pollution than paper.\n- TrumpetBiscuitPaws (2021-12-08): And this is why legislation (in the UK at least) limiting the sale/use of single use plastics contains exceptions to accommodate these needs. Medical devices, straws available on request etc. Its about cutting out all the frivolous uses or uses for which there are readily available, suitable alternatives. Things like straws arent even the big issue but they are something which, a lot of the time, isn't needed so they are the \"low hanging fruit\". Other more difficult, much larger changes at an industrial level are what's really needed - packaging, micro plastics in agriculture, fishing gear, etc. Consumer end choices/purchases like straws etc are a distraction, shifting the blame onto consumers and away from manufacturers who continue to pollute out planet on an epic scale while we feel bad over the millions of tiny choices we make. Phew sorry I got a bit ranty there. It really does get my goat though!",
  "summary": "The conversation about banning plastic straws is complex and multifaceted. It involves considerations of environmental impact, individual needs, and the responsibility of manufacturers. People express their concerns about the overuse of plastic and its impact on the environment, while also acknowledging the necessity of single-use plastics for individuals with disabilities and medical needs. There are also discussions about the larger problems of plastic waste, such as fishing gear and packaging, and the need for industrial-level changes. Overall, there is a mix of empathy for individual needs, frustration with the environmental impact of plastic, and a call for systemic changes.\n\nSentiment: 0.3",
