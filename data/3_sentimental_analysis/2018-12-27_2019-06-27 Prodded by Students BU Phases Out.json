Last Updated: February 19, 2020\n\n- TY FURMAN (2019-02-14): Will that include the \u201cstirrers\u201d at Starbucks?\n- PHILIPPE BLOCH (2019-02-14): This is great. I too have phased out plastic straws in my personal life replacing them with sustainable and recyclable/biodegradable straws for home and office use. However, I do have a stash of old straws that I don\u2019t know how to dispose of them properly. Just throwing them in the trash is the equivalent of having used them and they would still end up distressing the environment. Does anyone know how to dispose of these safely?\n- CHRIS (2019-02-15): Oh yes! Because you know, there are tens of thousands of sea turtles with them stuck up their noses\u2026\n- ALICE TORRENCE BALDWIN (2019-02-15): Wouldn\u2019t it be better just to teach people not to litter?\n- CJG (2020-02-19): Changing from a plastic to a paper straw with a Starbucks takeaway cup seems a trivial improvement compared to the volume of plastic in the takeaway cup. As Starbucks encourages the use of the pre-order app they discourage the use of re-usable cups. Remember the first word of the \u201cReduce-Reuse-Repair-Recycle mantra is REDUCE!\n\nBoston University Moderated Comments\nYour email address will not be published.
