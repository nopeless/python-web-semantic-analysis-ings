  "readable_content": "- realitybites365 (2019-09-09): Thank god CA banned plastic straws...\n- Jackmoved (2019-09-09): That's homeless colonies. Not \"trash\" being dumped. Home supply and demand is the main cause. 1.3 mil for some shit starter homes in the bay area caused this\n- Dan300up (2019-09-09): What is that white sea creature looking thing in the foreground?\n- AmbulanceDriver95 (2019-09-09): Oh no! There's so much trash! How pointless for anybody to try and reduce it, even by a little bit.\n- ibncali (2019-09-09): I\u2019m a child of the 70\u2019s, grew up in the 80\u2019s and I remember glass bottles and paper bags. Milk was sold in glass and we returned our coke bottles. How did we go so far so fast in the wrong direction?\n- Now_then_here_there (2019-09-09): Is CA California? or Canada? Just curious, not diverting.\n- [deleted] (2019-09-09): Now what will they snort with, they can use a bill.\n- BleedingTeal (2019-09-09): Except if they're requested or at non sit down restaurants. \n\nhttps://www.businessinsider.com/california-straw-ban-restaurants-what-you-need-to-know-2018-9\n- Formally_Nightman (2019-09-09): By straws the state meant homeless. Communication isn\u2019t their forte.",
