Here we present the results of a large-scale survey of neustonic micro- and meso-plastics floating in Mediterranean waters, providing the first extensive characterization of their chemical identity as well as detailed information on their abundance and geographical distribution. All particles >700\u2009\u03bcm collected in our samples were identified through FT-IR analysis (n\u2009=\u20094050 particles), shedding for the first time light on the polymeric diversity of this emerging pollutant. Sixteen different classes of synthetic materials were identified. Low-density polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene were the most abundant compounds, followed by polyamides, plastic-based paints, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene and polyvinyl alcohol. Less frequent polymers included polyethylene terephthalate, polyisoprene, poly(vinyl stearate), ethylene-vinyl acetate, polyepoxide, paraffin wax and polycaprolactone, a biodegradable polyester reported for the first time floating in off-shore waters. Geographical differences in sample composition were also observed, demonstrating sub-basin scale heterogeneity in plastics distribution and likely reflecting a complex interplay between pollution sources, sinks and residence times of different polymers at sea.\n   \nSimilar content being viewed by others\nSubstantial burial of terrestrial microplastics in the Three Gorges Reservoir, China\nArticle Open access\n14 February 2023\nFinding Plastic Patches in Coastal Waters using Optical Satellite Data\nArticle Open access\n23 April 2020\nThe rise in ocean plastics evidenced from a 60-year time series\nArticle Open access\n16 April 2019\nIntroduction\n- Global production of plastic materials increased twenty-fold in the last fifty years, exceeding 300 million tonnes in 20151. Demand is growing exponentially and production is expected to quadruple by 2050, taking up 20% of total oil consumption and 15% of the global carbon budget2. Single-use packaging applications represent the largest share of the European plastic market, accounting for 40% of the total production1 and for more than 10% of the municipal solid waste3. As a result, 275 million tonnes of plastic litter were generated in 2010 by the world\u2019s coastal countries, of which 4.8 to 12.7 million tonnes were estimated to have ended up in the oceans, a scenario projected to increase by an order of magnitude within 20253.\n- Since the first reports on the presence of plastic in the oceans, worldwide attention has been focussed to this problem and the number of scientific publications has seen an exponential growth4. Vast accumulation areas have been discovered in all main oceanic gyres5,6,7,8, and every part of the oceans examined so far, revealed the presence of marine litter, including polar seas9 and deep-sea sediments10. Plastic is now so abundant that it has been proposed as a new stratigraphic indicator of Anthropocene11.\n- Over 92% of all plastic items found at sea are generally smaller than 5\u2009mm12. These tiny particles \u2013 hereinafter referred to as microplastics \u2013 may either result from the breakdown of larger objects, or they can directly enter the marine environment as granules, pellets and fibers. Microplastics can act as dispersal vectors of chemical additives, organic and metal pollutants accumulated from surrounding waters13 and provide habitats for a wide range of rafting organisms and microbial communities14. Being in the same size class of many planktonic organisms, ingestion of microplastics is widely reported and the first evidences of trophic transfer are emerging15,16. As a result, indications of negative effects at both, individual and sub-organismal levels are starting to appear, to the extent that the classification of plastic waste as hazardous was recently suggested17.\n- Global models consistently predict some of the highest concentrations of floating plastics in the world to occur in the Mediterranean Sea12,18, to the extent that together with the main five oceanic gyres, it has been proposed as the sixth great accumulation zone for marine litter19. Mainly owing to limited outflow of surface waters, a densely populated coastline and intensive fishing, shipping, touristic and industrial activities, substantial amounts of marine litter are accumulating in the Mediterranean basin, which according to the most recent simulations is retaining between 21% and 54% of all plastic particles (i.e. between 3.2 and 28.2\u2009\u00d7\u20091012 particles) and between 5% and 10% of the global plastic mass (i.e. between 4.8 and 30.3 thousand tonnes)20.\n\nMediterranean biodiversity is certainly not immune from interaction with marine litter21. Artificial polymers have been found in the stomach contents of Mediterranean pelagic predators22, deep-sea fishes23 and commercial species24. Large amounts of plastic debris have been reported from the Mediterranean seafloor25 and floating on its surface26, as well as on beaches27,28 and coastal environments29,30. Studies on the abundance of floating micro-sized particles however, mostly focused on the NW part of the basin (Table 1) and the polymeric identity of such floating particles is still largely unknown.\n\nTable 1 Comparison of floating microplastic concentrations obtained in all previous studies performed in the Mediterranean Sea.\nFull size table\n\nThe European Marine Strategy Framework Directive (2008/56/EC) highlighted concerns for the environmental implications of marine litter and underlined the urgent need for member countries to \u201cDetermine trends in the amount, distribution and composition of micro-particles (mainly microplastics) in European waters and to establish baseline quantities, properties and potential impacts\u201d31. More recently, the importance of this issue has also been acknowledged by the Contracting Parties to the Barcelona Convention and by the G7 world leaders, who committed to a global action plan to combat marine litter32. Most of the surveys conducted so far however, mainly relied on the visual identification of particles, or characterized only a restricted subset of samples. Thus, detailed information on the actual polymeric diversity of these emerging pollutant is lacking.\n\nWithin this context, we present the results of a large-scale survey of micro (<5\u2009mm) and meso-plastics (5\u201320\u2009mm) occurrence in central-western Mediterranean waters, providing the largest polymeric characterization of floating microplastics ever performed (n\u2009=\u20094,050 particles). In agreement with numerical predictions, we confirm the Mediterranean Sea as severely contaminated by plastic pollution and",
  "summary": "The information presented here highlights the significant impact of plastic pollution on the Mediterranean Sea, emphasizing the urgent need to address the issue. The extensive survey provides detailed insights into the polymeric composition of microplastics in the region, shedding light on the scope and complexity of the problem. The findings underscore the necessity for comprehensive efforts to combat marine litter and its environmental implications. Sentiment: 0.8",
