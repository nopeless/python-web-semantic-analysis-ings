  "body": "Boston Market is the most underrated Fast Food chain. Tastes good, is healthy, is fairly quick, have a decent amount of options, and isn't too overpriced. I mean sure, if you don't love chicken it's probably not the best place for you, but I can't think of a chain where you can order a healthier meal that tastes as good. This thread is archived.",

I mean sure, if you don't love chicken it's probably not the best place for you, but I can't think of a chain where you can order a healthier meal that tastes as good.\n\nbusinessboyz (2019-07-25):\n- Healthy is questionable at best. Sure the chicken is chicken but the sides are HORRIBLE for you but so so delicious.\n\nKwhoisk (2019-07-25):\n- This was my favorite \u201cfast food\u201d place and I watched them open and quickly close locations for like a decade. Never understood why people chose shit food over this for the same price...\n\n[deleted] (2019-07-25):\n- I only ate there a few times, and everything seemed super salty to me. I ate at a few different locations, so it probably wasn't just one. While it wasn't \"bad\", it certainly did seem uninspiring.\n\nUnpopularOpinionMods (2019-07-25):\nIs this a Popular or Unpopular opinion?
