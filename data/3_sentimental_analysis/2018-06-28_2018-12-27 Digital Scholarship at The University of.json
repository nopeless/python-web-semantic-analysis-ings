The Repository aims to capture emerging unpublished scholarship and creative works of Sewanee authors/creators and to preserve and disseminate previously published works in a manner consistent with copyright law.\n\n- Author/creator submissions to DSpace may consist of various works including conference papers and presentations, working papers, white papers, technical reports, awarded student research, musical compositions, art, performances, books, and journal articles. In addition to the works of Sewanee authors/creators, the repository hosts selected archival materials, generated by administrative and academic departments, and digital collections created from the University Archival holdings to support teaching and research.\n\n- DSpace is the application of choice for digital repositories, developed by MIT and Hewlett-Packard, now sustained by the DuraSpace Foundation and a global community of developers and users. It allows managing, accessing, sharing, and preserving digital content of virtually any format.\n\n- Sewanee's instance of DSpace includes student, faculty, and university publications.\n\n- URL: https://library.sewanee.edu/digital\n\nJessie Ball duPont Library, University of the South\n178 Georgia Avenue, Sewanee, TN 37383\n931.598.1664",
