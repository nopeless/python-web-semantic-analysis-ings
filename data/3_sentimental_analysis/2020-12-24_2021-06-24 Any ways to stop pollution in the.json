  "body": "Green terrain in general and especially trees reduce pollution. If you're on a desert biome then biters will be much more difficult. 3 Efficiency1 modules in miners reduce both their pollution and energy consumption by 80%, but also produce a corresponding reduction in pollution from your power plant because it doesn't have to work as hard (miners are a huge percentage of your overall power load).",
  "readable_content": "- ItsYaBoi0706 (2020-12-08): Any ways to stop pollution in the factory, especially in miner outposts?\n\n- RoadWarrior_AA (2020-12-08): Efficiency mods drop energy consumption and pollution production.\n\n- ItsYaBoi0706 (2020-12-08): But I would need better ways to make all circuits, since the materials get used so fast.\n\n- StormCrow_Merfolk (2020-12-08): Green terrain in general and especially trees reduce pollution. If you're on a desert biome then biters will be much more difficult.\n\n    - DeHackEd (2020-12-08): To clarify, less power consumption does mean less work for the boilers and hence less pollution produced over there. But there's a not-very-well-documented fact that anything that raises/lowers power consumption of machines also raises/lowers the pollution production.\n\n    - TosACoinToYourSwitch (2020-12-08): Tanks with explosive shells and flamethrower fuel and a lot of military damage upgrades.\n\n    - tomashighlander (2020-12-08): Mass produce land mines and have your bots sprinkle them outside your perimeter. As many as will fit. \n\n        - ItsYaBoi0706 (2020-12-08): I didn't even know land mines existed.\n\n    - paco7748 (2020-12-08): A few Eff1 modules in all your miners (especially at outposts away from your main base) is the #1 recommended place to put them to reduce pollution and energy costs.\n\n    - BeardedMontrealer (2020-12-08): 3 eff1s is cheaper though ;)\n\n    - BeardedMontrealer (2020-12-08): If your power plant's pollution is causing problems, I'd suggest nuclear power. It's an upfront investment, but a 4-core nuclear reactor produces 480MW while consuming a truly tiny amount of uranium.\n\n    - sevaiper (2020-12-08): If you want to avoid the annoyance and just build, peaceful mode.\n\n    - Tonkarz (2020-12-08): Trees will absorb pollution and efficiency modules will vastly reduce pollution. Grass tiles absorb more pollution than deserts.",
