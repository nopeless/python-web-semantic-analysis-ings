  "body": "I normally just close the ziploc bag almost all the way, just enough that i could slip in a straw, then i suck all the air out through a straw, and then quickly slip out the straw and close the bag the rest of the way. This sounds better. Because I haven't dared use my method when I'm for example freezing raw chicken.",
  "readable_content": "- fox_91: When storing food in a ziplock bag, does removing as much air as possible (without a vacuum) cause less spoilage than leaving more air in? \n  - NoraTC: In my experience, though not scientific, it does. Getting the air out is easy enough to make it worthwhile though even if my experience is idiosyncratic: just submerge the filled bag in a bowl of water right up to the zip lock line. The water does the work; you just need to dry the bowl afterwards. This works for storage, freezing and beer cooler sous vide.\n  - TheFoodScientist: It helps when you're freezing whatever is in the bag... /r/AskCulinary\n- b0b0tempo: Even if it didn't, and I kind of think it does, removing as much air makes storage easier... /r/AskCulinary\n- kermityfrog: Spoilage from bacteria or spoilage from oxidization? It won't do much for bacteria as long as the air is sterile, but air might make stuff turn brown or dry... /r/AskCulinary\n- sean_incali: Over a longer term, sure, air is responsible for the \"freezer burn\" If you have a lot of air in the bag, the moisture will come out and condense on the surface which will just melt away once thawed. /r/AskCulinary",
