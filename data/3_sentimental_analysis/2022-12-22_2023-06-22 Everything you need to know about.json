The reason? Humanity produces more than 430 million tonnes of plastic annually, two-thirds of which are short-lived products that soon\u00a0become waste, filling the ocean and, often, working their way into the human food chain.\n\n\u201cMany people aren\u2019t aware that a material that is embedded in our daily life can have significant impacts not just on wildlife, but on the climate and on human health,\u201d says Lloren\u00e7 Mil\u00e0 i Canals, Head of the United Nations Environment Programme\u2019s (UNEP\u2019s) Life Cycle Initiative.\n\nRead our explainer to find out more about the plastic pollution crisis:\n\nWhy is plastic pollution such a problem?\n- Affordable, durable and flexible, plastic pervades modern life, appearing in everything from packaging to clothes to beauty products. But it is thrown away on a massive scale: every year, more than 280 million tonnes of short-lived plastic products become waste.\n\nIs pollution the only problem with plastic?\n- No, it also contributes to the climate crisis. The production of plastic is one of the most energy-intensive manufacturing processes in the world. The material is made from fossil fuels such as crude oil, which are transformed via heat and other additives into a polymer. In 2019, plastics generated 1.8 billion metric tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 3.4 per cent of the global total.\n\nWhere is all this plastic coming from?\n- The packaging sector is the largest generator of single-use plastic waste \u00adin the world. Approximately 36 per cent of all plastics produced are used in packaging. This includes single-use plastic food and beverage containers, 85 per cent of which end up in landfills or as mismanaged waste.\n\nI have heard people talk about microplastics. What are those?\n- They are tiny shards of plastic measuring up to 5mm in length. They come from everything from tires to beauty products, which contain microbeads, tiny particles used as exfoliants. Another key source is synthetic fabrics. Every time clothing is washed, the pieces shed tiny plastic fibres called microfibres \u2013 a form of microplastics. Laundry alone causes around 500,000 tonnes of plastic microfibres to be released into the ocean every year \u2013the equivalent of almost 3 billion polyester shirts.\n\nWhat is being done about plastic pollution?\n- In 2022, UN Member States agreed on a resolution to end plastic pollution. An Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee is developing a legally binding instrument on plastic pollution, with the aim of having it finalized by the end of 2024. Critically, the talks have focused on measures considering the entire life cycle of plastics, from extraction and product design to production to waste management, enabling opportunities to design out waste before it is created as part of a thriving circular economy.\n\nWhat more needs to be done?\n- While this progress is good news, current commitments by governments and industry are not enough. To effectively tackle the plastic pollution crisis, systemic change is needed. This means, moving away from the current linear plastic economy, which centres on producing, using and discarding the material, to a circular plastic economy, where the plastic that is produced is kept in the economy at its highest value for as long as possible.\n\nHow can countries make that a reality?\n- Countries need to encourage innovation and provide incentives to businesses that do away with unnecessary plastics. Taxes are needed to deter the production or use of single-use plastic products, while tax breaks, subsidies and other fiscal incentives need to be introduced to encourage alternatives, such as reusable products. Waste management infrastructure must also be improved. Governments can also engage in the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee process to forge a legally binding instrument that tackles plastic pollution, including in the marine environment.\n\nWhat can the average person do about plastic pollution?\n- While the plastic pollution crisis needs systemic reform, individual choices do make a difference. Such as shifting behavior to avoid single-use plastic products whenever possible. If plastic products are unavoidable, they should be reused or repurposed until they can no longer be used \u2013 at which point they should be recycled or disposed of properly. Bring bags to the grocery store, and if possible, striving to purchase locally sourced and seasonal food options that require less plastic packaging and transport.\n\nShould I lobby governments and businesses to address plastic pollution?\n- Yes. One of the most important actions individuals can take is to ensure their voice is heard by talking to their local representatives about the importance of the issue, and supporting businesses that are striving to reduce single-use plastic products in their supply chains. Individuals can also show their support for them on social media. If people see a company using unnecessary plastic (such as single-use plastics covering fruit at a grocery store) they can contact them and ask them to do better.\n\nFor more information on how you can help tackle the plastic pollution crisis, download the Beat Plastic Pollution Practical Guide.\n\nAbout World Environment Day\nWorld Environment Day on 5 June is the biggest international day for the environment. Led by UNEP and held annually since 1973, the event has grown to be the largest global platform for environmental outreach, with millions of people from across the world engaging to protect the planet. This year, World Environment Day will focus on solutions to the plastic pollution crisis.",
