  "readable_content": "- \"Myths about plastic pollution are leading to public confusion: here\u2019s why\" (2023-11-20): Does the prediction that there could be \u201cmore plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050\u201d concern you? How about reports that \u201cwe eat a credit card\u2019s worth of plastic per week\u201d? These are some of the \u201cfacts\u201d about plastic that are cited by the media. They are certainly compelling sound bites and help to focus public and policy attention on the pressing topic of plastic pollution, but their scientific basis is far from robust.\n\n- The scientists whose findings were used to support the \u201cmore plastic than fish\u201d claim refuted this. But one scientist who worked on the original source the estimation is based on has now updated his figures. The claim is further undermined by the assumptions the calculation is based on and an underestimate of fish stocks. Research has also found that humans ingest less than a grain of salt of microplastics each week. This means that it would take around 4,700 years to ingest an amount of plastic equivalent to the weight of a credit card.\n\n- Over the past three years, households in the UK, Spain, and Germany have been interviewed about plastics as part of a project focused on improving plastic packaging recycling. A new online resource called \u201cPlastic Mythbusters\u201d has been launched to debunk popular plastic myths that regularly feature in media.\n\n- The UN Environment Programme is currently negotiating a global plastics treaty, with calls for decisions to be based on robust evidence. The media's role in shaping public and policy responses to the plastics crisis is discussed. Emotive images and scenes, such as those from the BBC\u2019s Blue Planet II, have an impact on public awareness. The media's portrayal of plastic pollution and its influence on solutions and public perceptions are also highlighted.\n\n- In response to the article, a BBC spokesperson stated that there is scientific evidence supporting the accumulation of contaminants in some plastics, leading to ingestion by adult whales and passing on to offspring through the mother\u2019s milk.",
