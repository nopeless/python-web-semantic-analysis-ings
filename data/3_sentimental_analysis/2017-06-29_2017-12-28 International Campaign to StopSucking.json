Photo by Sara Bernard\n\nIt may seem like a very small and inconsequential thing\u2014a slim plastic straw in your iced latte or bubble tea\u2014but in part because Americans use and toss 500 million of them every single day, by 2050, we\u2019re on track to have a larger volume of plastic in our oceans than fish.\n\n500 million straws per day \u201cis almost an unbelievable number,\u201d said Dune Ives, executive director of the Lonely Whale Foundation, a marine-environment advocacy group co-founded by actor and filmmaker Adrian Grenier, speaking at a press event at the Seattle Aquarium Thursday. \"It\u2019s unthinkable, really. How could we use so many straws?\" Although straws and other disposable plastic products are \u201cseemingly so innocent,\u201d she said, their collective impact is huge. Grenier\u2014who in addition to being known for his role on the TV series Entourage was recently named the United Nations\u2019 Environment Programme Goodwill Ambassador\u2014added another grim statistic: \u201cEach year, eight million-plus tons of plastic ends up in the ocean. That\u2019s the equivalent of a full garbage truck every minute.\u201d\n\nJoined by the Port of Seattle, CenturyLink Field, the Seattle Seahawks, Mayor Ed Murray, and a lengthy list of restauranteurs and other participating companies, Ives and Grenier showed up at the Aquarium to celebrate the launch of Strawless in Seattle, a campaign to get businesses, institutions, and individuals to either stop using straws, or switch to paper straws, during the month of September, and (they hope) beyond.\n\n\u201cWe see single-use plastic straws as a gateway,\u201d said Grenier. \u201cPeople ask me all the time, \u2018Well, why not plastic lids and plastic cups? Why are you focusing on straws?\u2019 And I say, \u2018Well, are we focused on straws? You just directed the focus to the bigger issue.\u2019 It\u2019s an entry point for most people.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s announcement means that, starting now, over 200 restaurants, all the concessionaires at Sea-Tac Airport, all the hotels that belong to Columbia Hospitality (among other sites, Columbia owns the Salish Lodge & Spa in North Bend), and everything sold at CenturyLink Field, among other venues, will only be serving marine-safe paper straws. Many of those spots have committed to doing so for the foreseeable future, too.\n\n\u201cThe Seahawks, we understand our reach,\u201d said David Young, senior vice president of operations for the Seahawks and general manager of CenturyLink Field. \u201cWith that reach comes a big responsibility.\u201d He said CenturyLink already recycles or composts almost all of the waste it generates (Seattle as a whole composts and recycles just shy of 60 percent), and it does, in fact, already offer compostable straws. But he said he was committed to changing that, too, because apparently, only paper straws are good for marine environments. Most of so-called \u201ccompostable\u201d plastic can only be broken down in special facilities, according to both Grenier and Port Commissioner Fred Felleman, who spent three decades working on Pacific Northwest marine conservation before he was elected in 2015. Although there are several types of compostable plastic, \u201cMost of them act very plastic-like in the marine environment,\u201d said Felleman. \u201cI don\u2019t think in our lifetime they would break down at all.\u201d\n\nAfter Seattle, the Lonely Whale Foundation has plans to take its campaign across the country, and then the world; in 2018, the campaign will spread to at least ten U.S. cities, Grenier said, although they\u2019ve seen so much interest already, it could be more. The organization\u2019s immediate goal is to divert 500 million plastic straws from the waste stream, with a longer-term goal of 15 billion.\n\nBut it started its efforts in Seattle in part because the Emerald City is very low-hanging fruit. Ives, the former head of Paul Allen\u2019s Vulcan Philanthropy, grew up and lives in Seattle, for one. But \u201cSeattle has also been a leader in environmental change,\u201d said Grenier, especially when it comes to plastics. In 2008, the City Council passed an ordinance that banned polystyrene (commonly known by the brand name Styrofoam) and required businesses to phase out the use of disposable plastic service ware, including cups and plates and to-go boxes. In 2010, it passed another ordinance officially prohibiting them. Over the years, the city has revisited and modified the list of items it prohibits. In 2012, it officially banned plastic bags, for instance, with a few exceptions, such as bulk food bags and newspaper delivery bags. However, city enforcement of the plastic service ware bans has been fairly nonexistent so far because the compostable options weren\u2019t widely available, or all that functional; restaurants didn\u2019t have a lot to choose from.\n\n\u201cEvery year we\u2019ve eliminated more disposable items,\u201d Murray told the room, but until now, there were no viable alternatives to the plastic straw. But because that\u2019s changed\u2014a number of sustainable-serviceware companies, including Aardvark, the company the campaigners were promoting Thursday, are now creating durable paper straws\u2014\u201cIn 2018 our Director of Public Utilities \u2026 will make a rule so that plastic straws are included in the things that we will be proactively limiting from our environment.\u201d\n\nAdded SPU director Mami Hara in a brief conversation after the event, the plastic-straw ban has theoretically been in place for nearly a decade, but \u201cwe provide an exemption every year until the market is ready. In July 2018, that [plastic straw and utensil] exemption expires. We would be enforcing the ban at that point.\u201d\n\nThis is, by the way, for food service only; \u201cyou can still buy [plastic straws] at the grocery store,\u201d said Becca Fong, spokesperson for SPU\u2019s Solid Waste Division.\n\nNotably absent from the day\u2019s fanfare was Starbucks, a gigantic Seattle-based company that still uses a heck of a lot of plastic straws. Hara said that she knows they\u2019re working on a transition, though, and other SPU staffers confirmed that every food-service business, including Starbucks, will not be allowed to serve plastic straws next summer. (Fong urged any business with questions or concerns to contact SPU\u2019s Green Business Program, which offers lots of free tools and assistance with this kind of thing.)\n\nEveryone present stressed the importance of the effort, however inconsequential it seems. \u201cScientific studies are now showing that fish flesh is showing signs of plastic fibers,\u201d said Ives. \u201cThat means that the straw that we use today that turns into microplastics that is then nibbled on by fish could end up on our plates.\u201d\n\nFelleman added that although he\u2019s not aware of a current estimate of the tonnage of plastics in Puget Sound, its geography acts like \u201ca bathtub,\u201d collecting and holding on to whatever is tossed into it. Toxins biolaccumulate in the fatty tissue of both wild salmon and orca. And \u201cplastic actually draws other pollution to it,\u201d he said. \u201cA straw in the marine environment is actually worse than on land.\u201d All of that is why he sees the campaign as \u201cexciting\u201d and consistent with the Port\u2019s environmental goals. Sea-Tac Airport, in particular, \u201cis the gateway to Seattle, if not the whole Northwest. And if we care about something as small as straws, that sets a mindset, as a visitor, as a newcomer. We care about even the little things.\u201d\n\nGrenier said that he\u2019s spent a lot of time in Seattle over the years, and also sang its praises. \u201cI love Seattle, I love the people, I love the openness and the can-do attitude,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the\n",
