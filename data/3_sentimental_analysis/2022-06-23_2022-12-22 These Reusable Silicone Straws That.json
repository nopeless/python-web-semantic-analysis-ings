  "readable_content": "- Fkn_stress_rxn (2022-12-08): These Re-usable Silicone Straws That \"Zipper\" So You Can Clean Them Without a Special Brush and Surprisingly Work Really Well.\n- AndyTroop (2022-12-08): We have some like this for 3 years - easy to put into the dishwasher, and great for smoothies.\n- choopchooppeachy (2022-12-08): I love these. Not great for sodas, they tend to fizz like crazy going through the straw, but for everything else they're amazing. I use them for smoothies in specific since I can then open them and make sure to get out all of the teeny tiny seeds.\n- [deleted] (2022-12-08): Low key thought that was pasta for a second. That's really smart though!\n- The-Fumbler (2022-12-08): My fat ass thought it was spaghetti\n- Emily_Postal (2022-12-08): I don\u2019t like silicone straws because they\u2019re too flexible. They don\u2019t work well with the plastic tops with the x holes. They collapse like it\u2019s a hose with a kink in it. I prefer the steel ones.\n- Fkn_stress_rxn (2022-12-08): I don't like metal bc they have a weird taste to me (maybe psychological). I've had that problem too, but these work well since they have to be thick for the Zipper\n- glittery_grandma (2022-12-08): I have these and love them. I used single use plastic straws before as a way to drink more that wasn\u2019t a sensory nightmare and then when they were banned here (which I still stand by being a short sighted decision) I was just pretty dehydrated for a while. I have multiple disabilities and these straws let me see inside them so I know they\u2019re clean which was a fear of mine when trusting others to (very kindly) wash up my straws. They\u2019re great. I got mine from Amazon.\n- Fkn_stress_rxn (2022-12-08): I like that I can chew them like a plastic straw \ud83d\ude43 I hate the feel of metal. I love my glass Straws too, but I always want to bite them lol\n- JordanGrace24 (2022-12-08): WHOAHHH. This is pretty neat\n- cumberber (2022-12-08): Does anyone have a link to purchase these\n- tenkohime (2022-12-08): I thought someone would post a brand name or shop link. I like the idea of it.\n- Fkn_stress_rxn (2022-12-08): The brand is \"SqueakyCleanStraw\". I don't have a link, I found them on the clearance rack.",
