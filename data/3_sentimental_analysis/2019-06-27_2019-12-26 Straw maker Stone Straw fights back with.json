  "readable_content": "**Canadian Plastics**\nJuly 9, 2019\n\nTraditional plastic straws are an endangered species nowadays, which is why this well-known Brantford, Ont.-based extruder is making the move to an eco-friendly plant-based alternative.\n\nAbe Looy with a handful of Stone Straw\u2019s new Back to Earth compostable straws.\n\nAlmost 70 million years ago, a mass extinction wiped out three-quarters of the plant and animal species on Earth, the dinosaurs famously among them. Only those few species that could adapt were able to survive, including the ancestors of modern birds, turtles, and crocodiles.\n\nFast forward to today and another extinction seems to be taking place: plastic straws. The major focus of recent environmental campaigns, single-use plastic straws have gone, almost overnight, from ubiquitous to endangered, with more and more cities, restaurant chains, movie theatres, sports facilities, and even airlines phasing them out. And we can now add entire countries to the list, with the recent announcement that Canada plans to ban all single-use plastic items \u2013 which will definitely include straws \u2013 by as early as 2021.\n\nBut human behaviour is difficult to change. People still prefer straws \u2014 some people with disabilities need them \u2014 and while metal, paper, and silicone straws have received some attention, none have caught on. Stone Straw, a straw manufacturer since 1888, saw an opportunity to adapt and not only survive, but thrive. A long-time extruder of traditional plastic straws, the Brantford, Ont.-based company is going plant-based with its new Back to Earth compostable plastic straws.\n-ADVERTISEMENT-\n\nStone Straw is practically synonymous with straws. The company\u2019s founder, Marvin Stone, invented the original paper straw almost 140 years ago, and his invention was the go-to choice until plastic varieties became the standard in the 1970s. Today, Stone Straw and its parent company Wentworth Technologies manufactures about 300 types of plastic straws, stirrers, plastic cups, and lids \u2013 which puts it at Ground Zero in the war against single-use plastic. \u201cOur industry is under enormous pressure from consumers and the food service and hospitality industry, and we were definitely feeling it too, and it was beginning to affect our customer base,\u201d said Abe Looy, the company\u2019s regional operations manager. \u201cOur straws have traditionally been made with polypropylene, and orders for them were beginning to drop. So we got proactive: Rather than waiting until the bans on single-use plastics take effect, we got ahead of the bans by moving from PP into biopolymers early on, on our own, and we\u2019re encouraging our customers to get ahead of them too.\u201d\n\nIntroduced to the market a few short weeks ago, Stone Straw\u2019s Back to Earth straws are made with a compostable biopolymer. \u201cWe worked with a major chemical supplier to develop a material that\u2019s compostable but also robust enough for our profile extrusion,\u201d Looy said. \u201cThe supplier developed something that looks, feels, and performs like PP but can be certified as industrially compostable.\u201d\n\nAnd that last part is key. Back to Earth straws have been approved by the Biodegradable Plastics Institute, which ensures the material is consumed by microbes, which allows the straws to contribute to the circular economy by creating valuable compost; and also meets ASTM D6400 and/or D6868 standards, which means that in 180 days or less the straws will decompose to 90 per cent CO2 and 10 per cent biomass in an industrial or municipal composter. \u201cHaving this certification is important because Stone Straw is the only supplier that most of our customers has ever had, and when we ask them to make the switch from PP to compostable straws, they have to be able to trust us,\u201d Looy said.\n\nOne of Stone Straw\u2019s bigger customers is Booster Juice, which is now transitioning to Back to Earth straws in all of its Canadian stores. Known for their signature smoothies, Booster Juice has a unique product that cannot be easily consumed without a straw, so it was receptive to the new compostable straws from the get-go. \u201cWe worked closely with Booster Juice to develop the right straw for its product, fine-tuning every detail, including the packaging and developing a bright purple colour,\u201d Looy said. \u201cThe straws can now be easily recognized by customers and come in one size, which can be used in all of Booster Juice\u2019s beverages.\u201d Other quick service restaurants are also interested in the straws, Looy said.\n\nSo how cutting-edge are the Back to Earth straws? \u201cWe\u2019re the first company in North America to extrude this type of biopolymer for straws,\u201d Looy said. \u201cSeveral companies in Southeast Asia are making these straws and importing them into Canada, and a few companies in the U.S. are trialing this material for straws, but that\u2019s the extent of it.\u201d\n\nLEARNING CURVES\n\nBut this newness wasn\u2019t without a set of challenges, beginning with the material itself. \u201cMore traditional, neat PLA is brittle and can shatter, whereas straws have to be able to bend,\u201d Looy said. \u201cSo we had to work with our chemical supplier to develop a proprietary, functionalized variation to the standard PLA that\u2019s offered in the market today.\u201d\n\nStone Straw also had to make some changes to the machinery on its shop floor. \u201cTo a certain extent extrusion is extrusion, but once the product leaves the die, differences in material properties come into play, and this biopolymer is a much different material than PP,\u201d Looy said. \u201cWe had to custom-build some of our profile extruders to process a compostable resin, and also had to miniaturize a silo to store the material properly because it has to be kept absolutely dry.\u201d In a nutshell, Looy said, processing this compostable polymer requires customized speeds, lower temperatures, and much more accurate controls compared to PP. \u201cWithout that combination, you\u2019ll have product failure \u2013 we know, because we had plenty of product failure during our trials,\u201d he said.\n\nFinally, there was a learning curve for all of Stone Straw\u2019s 65 employees. \u201cAll of our workers had to understand this material and its quirks, from the engineering department to maintenance to machine operators,\u201d Looy said. \u201cNow that we\u2019ve all got a handle on it, it seems easy, but it was difficult at the time because we had only ever run PP. The motivation was, if we want to still be in business five years from now we had to make this transition, and everybody understood.\u201d\n\nAs innovative as it is, the Back to Earth straw still isn\u2019t the final word on sustainability. \u201cWe\u2019re working on a successor product right now \u2013 a plastic straw that decomposes in the marine environment, which means the effective end of straws polluting oceans and waterways,\u201d Looy said. \u201cIt\u2019ll also be certifiable for landfill, not just industrial composters, which means that it will be certifiable for everywhere that a post-consumer straw could conceivably end up, 100 per cent of the time. My colleagues and I jokingly call it the Holy Grail of straws, but once we get the chemistry worked out, it\u2019s definitely doable.\u201d\n\nWhich means, despite the considerable pressures, plastic straws don\u2019t have to go the way of the dinosaurs.",
