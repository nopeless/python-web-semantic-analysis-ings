Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\n\n---\n\n- The FinalStraw was the best reusable straw we tested overall.\n\nBEST OVERALL\nThe FinalStraw\n\nA Kickstarter that was backed by more than 38,000 people, the FinalStraw has really changed the reusable straw game. Not only does it have an incredible pun, but it\u2019s really the only straw we tested that had a great balance of usability and portability.\n\nMade of stainless steel, it has silicone tubing that allows you to fold it up in a convenient carrying case. Although it doesn\u2019t bend while you're using it, the silicone provides a more comfortable mouthfeel and taste compared to other metal straws.\n\nThe best part is that its carrying case attaches to your keychain. If you can remember your keys, you can remember your straw. I was able to easily bring this straw to coffee shops, restaurants, and the office. Cleaning the straw is simple, too, as a brush is included in the case. It's convenient enough to even wash it in the bathroom of a restaurant.\n\nThe FinalStraw has expanded to seven hues ranging from standard silver to a psychedelic rainbow hue, and the carrying case comes in five different colors with cheeky names like Porpoise-Ful Purple and Sea Tur-Teal. Admittedly, the FinalStraw is pretty pricey, but it could be the final straw you need, so we think it\u2019s well worth it for a straw that is this portable.\n\nPros\n\nVery portable\n\nMade of stainless steel\n\nPretty design\n\nCons\n\nExpensive\n\nBuy now at Amazon\nCredit: Reviewed / Jackson Ruckar",
