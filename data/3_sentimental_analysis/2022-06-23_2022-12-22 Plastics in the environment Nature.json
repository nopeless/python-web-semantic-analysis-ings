Improperly managed waste disposal sites can leak plastics to the environment, requiring immediate action. Mitigation must be supported by research to quantify the scale of the problem and prioritize efforts. (Source: Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, November 9, 2022)\n\n- The status and fate of oceanic garbage patches\n  - Floating plastic is accumulating in the five subtropical oceanic gyres, but little is known about their composition, sources, and fate. Monitoring has provided insight into persistence and accumulation processes in the North Pacific Ocean, but their relevance in other gyres is unknown. Identifying the sources of plastics, in all subtropical gyres, is necessary for cleanup efforts to be effective. (Source: Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, November 9, 2022)\n\n- The need for a dedicated marine plastic litter satellite mission\n  - Monitoring marine plastic pollution requires repeated, long-term, global and harmonised observations of plastic presence, quantity and type, which satellites can provide. To convince space agencies to take action, coordinated activities are urgently needed to agree on target environments and to integrate in situ and satellite-derived measurements. (Source: Nature Reviews Earth & Environment, November 9, 2022)\n\n- Accumulation, transformation and transport of microplastics in estuarine fronts\n  - Large quantities of plastics flow from rivers to estuaries, where they potentially converge in frontal zones. This Perspective describes the occurrence, transformation and impact of these processes, highlighting their importance in mitigating plastic pollution.
