Everywhere, Scientists Find.\n\nThere's \"no nook or cranny\" on the planet where it doesn't end up, the lead researcher on a new study said.\n\nBy John Schwartz\n\nJune 11, 2020\n\nPlastic pollution isn\u2019t just fouling the world\u2019s oceans. It is also in the air we breathe, traveling on the wind and drifting down from the skies, according to a new study. More than 1,000 tons of tiny fragments rain down each year on national parks and wilderness areas in the American West alone, equivalent to between 123 million and 300 million plastic bottles worth.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no nook or cranny on the surface of the earth that won\u2019t have microplastics,\u201d said Janice Brahney, a Utah State University scientist who is lead author on the new study.\n\n- Full article can be accessed on The New York Times website.",
  "summary": "The text highlights the pervasive nature of plastic pollution, with microplastics being found in the air we breathe and even in remote areas like national parks and wilderness areas. It underscores the urgent need for measures to address and mitigate plastic pollution on a global scale. \n\nSentiment: 0.9",
