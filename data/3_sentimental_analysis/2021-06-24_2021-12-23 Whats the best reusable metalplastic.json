  "readable_content": "Mikzoru (2021-12-08): What's the best reusable metal/plastic straws?\n\nCan anyone recommend some high quality metal or plastic reusable straws that will last me a long time? Preferably I'd like them to be easy to wash, too. I've heard some come with their own cleaning kits, but I don't know which exactly.\n\n- Specialist-Affect-19 (2021-12-08): I like glass straws because it doesn't add a flavor to what you're drinking. They can break if you don't take care, but I still have most of them (and you could break a plastic straw anyway). I've given them as gifts and my friends said they really liked them. Mine came with little pipe cleaners.\n\n- Chickadove (2021-12-08): I agree; I also like that since they're clear, it's easy to tell that they're clean. I have a little more trouble trusting an opaque straw not to have anything stuck in it. I've had my glass straws for a couple years now and they've not chipped or broken (I hand-wash them). I don't know the brand of mine though, sorry OP.\n\n- catsmusiclife (2021-12-08): I would recommend silicone or bamboo straws. Metal ones can be cold on your teeth sometimes.\n\n- gosharksgosharks (2021-12-08): I like the GoSili (food grade silicone) straws because they aren\u2019t hard on my teeth and there is no cutting risk (I had a metal straw that was super sharp and cut cutting my lips and gums). Some of the GoSili straws come in a reusable travel tin that you can fold the straw up into, which is convenient for when you\u2019re on the go! I got mine from target but you could also get them directly from the company: [link]\n\n- TheEcoOne (2021-12-08): No straw is the best eco straw!\n\n- ajm1925 (2021-12-08): We have some TruEarth metal straws. They came with a little pipe cleaner and we\u2019ve liked them well enough. I think an easy to wash reusable straw is a bit of an oxymoron. By nature, a slender hollow tube is always going to be annoying to clean. But as long as we rinse the straws right after using them, it\u2019s just an extra minute to get the pipe cleaner through them.\n\n- ResponsiblePen3082 (2021-12-08): Recommend either metal, bamboo, or silicone. Other types have too many downsides. I've used silicone in the past(before I lost them), if you get a quality brand you'll have no issues. Only complaint is it can be hard to get through tough openings or frozen drinks (will likely bend before pushing through). Upsides are soft, easy on lips, don't contract heat much, and easily storable. Also have the advantage of being able to be designed in a way to be openable. Highly recommend going that route if you decide on silicone. Metal downsides are potentially being tough on lips/teeth and contracting heat. Some people say they can taste the metal, that shouldn't happen if you get a quality brand, or type of metal-I recommend titanium if you can find it. Upsides are of course being sturdier and as a result being able to puncture through tough lids and drinks. I use my titanium straw every time I go out, keep it in my car. Bamboo I haven't used at all, but I'd think it's just about the same as metal, probably without the heat concern, but im guessing potentially taste, and concern of biodegrading if not cleaned properly.",
