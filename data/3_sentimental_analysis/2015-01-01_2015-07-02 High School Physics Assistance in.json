  "readable_content": "pbandasiantime (2014-12-08): Aim: To determine the internal radius of a drinking straw. Apparatus: measuring cylinder, beaker, drinking straw, ruler, water. My teacher instructed our class to use these set apparatus to assist us in the lab. I am currently stomped on how to do this. I believe I am able to use more materials, excluding a micrometer gauge. Anybody able to assist me or give me an example on how to go about this lab? Thank you.\n\n- Alkalannar (2014-12-08): Measure the height of the straw. Fill it with water. Measure how much volume the water is. What's the volume of a cylinder? You know the cylinder's height, and it's volume\u2026.find the radius.\n\n- vrxz (2014-12-08): Full Volume of straw (including outer radius): V = \u03c0 Ro2 H Volume of liquid inside straw (using inner radius): V = \u03c0 Ri2 H Equation relating inner and outer radii, where x is the thickness of the cylinder of plastic of the straw: Ri + x = Ro x = Ro - Rx Volume of plastic making up straw: V = \u03c0 (Ro - Ri)2 H(Edited last equation to make it correct)",
