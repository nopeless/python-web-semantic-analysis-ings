  "readable_content": "- The Guardian (2017-09-05): Exclusive research reveals that microplastic contamination has been found in tap water across the globe, with scores of tap water samples from various nations showing contamination with plastic fibers. The US had the highest contamination rate at 94%, while European nations had the lowest at 72%. Microplastic expert Dr. Sherri Mason expressed concern about the impact of microplastics on wildlife and humans, citing potential health risks associated with the ingestion of plastic particles and the chemicals or pathogens that they can harbor. The article also highlighted the ubiquitous presence of microplastics in the global environment, with concerns raised about the potential consequences of widespread plastic pollution. There were calls for urgent research into the implications for health and the need to determine whether ingesting plastic particles poses a health risk. The article also discussed the potential sources of microplastic contamination, including atmospheric fallout, household wastewater, and commercial bottled water.",
  "summary": "The concerns about microplastic contamination in tap water and its potential impact on wildlife and human health are alarming. The widespread presence of microplastics in the global environment raises urgent concerns and calls for further research and action to address plastic pollution. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
