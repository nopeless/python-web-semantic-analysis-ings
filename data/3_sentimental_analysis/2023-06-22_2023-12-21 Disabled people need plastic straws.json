  "readable_content": "- Mindless-Run5641 (2023-07-25): \u201cDisabled people need plastic straws\u201d- wouldn\u2019t metal straws work?\nI\u2019ve seen a lot about how banning plastic straws hurts disabled people who need them, but wouldn\u2019t metal straws work? I\u2019ve never seen this mentioned and I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m missing something. It seems like it would work- reducing plastic while also having straws for people who need them. Is it that metal straws aren\u2019t flexible like plastic straws or something?\nI\u2019m disabled myself so I\u2019m not asking because I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re needed, but because I haven\u2019t seen anyone talk about metal straws and I\u2019m confused. TIA\n\n- [deleted] (2023-07-25): It depends, some disabled people may not be strong enough to support a heavier metal straw in their mouth, or even have the power to suck through it.\n\n- Aginor404 (2023-07-25): Metal straws can be dangerous because they are not flexible. People with tourette syndrome or epilepsy probably shouldn't use them.\n\n- Shaycat501 (2023-07-25): In their own homes, a metal straw might be a usable option. It would depend on their disability and their exact needs.\nBut, it would be fairly inconvenient to take a metal straw with them if they go places. It would be inconvenient for restaurants to supply them.\nAlso, metal straws aren't flexible. There is no movement for getting the correct angle. If the angle on the metal straw is wrong for the disabled person's needs, then there is no way to adjust the angle.\n\n- Gertrudethecurious (2023-07-25): You don't need to use plastic straws. There are 'plastic' biodegradable straws which feel the same.\n- betterworkbitch (2023-07-25): Fun fact: often people with shellfish allergies cannot use these straws because they contain some sort of sea shell.\n \n- jurassicbond (2023-07-25): What kind of disabilities make it harder to use paper straws than plastic straws?\n \n- CalgaryChris77 (2023-07-25): I think the idea is that many places are satisfying the law by getting rid of straws completely. You\u2019d have to bring your metal straw with you as well since you wouldn\u2019t get something like that for free with every drink.",
