I wanted to share this with you: http://www.crayoncollection.org/pdf/EarthDayEcoNormalCrayonCollection.pdf\n- jane (2017-01-06): I love just thinking about the power of each of us to stop this nasty habit!\n- jmrohling@gmail.com (2017-02-14): Thank you so much for bringing attention to an issue most of us just overlook. I rarely use straws in restaurants, don\u2019t use them in my own re-usable \"go cups\" and never use them at home. It just hasn\u2019t occurred to me to ASK not to have one at restaurants. I will from now on! \n- lesley@read.org.nz (2017-05-08): Why don\u2019t we use the paper straws I grew up with? Aren\u2019t there enough trees?\n- haydigul@gmail.com (2017-08-16): This also causes the death of Sea Turtles. I can\u2019t just watch this happen. We need do something instead of doing nothing!\n- Ellen Burton (2017-08-31): I have stopped going to restaurants that use unrequested plastic straws. But feel that it matters little if I don\u2019t tell at least to wait people, why I won\u2019t return to their place of business.\n- erinmorlock82@gmail.com (2018-01-05): I am 9 years old and my name is Gwenyth. I have been getting so so so sad after I watched the movie A Plastic Ocean! I even made a little blog! It\u2019s called https://friendsoftheocean.wordpress.com and I hope that you, if you haven\u2019t already, can watch A Plastic Ocean. I am so happy you are doing this. Thank you so much! Sincerely, Gwen\n- Tricia (2018-02-15): We make beautiful reusable straws out of wood https://www.etsy.com/listing/50454465/handcrafted-wood-straw-wood-sipper?ref=shop_home_active_3\n- bnbdangelo@aol.com (2018-07-13): no plastic straws, no plastic bags, this is where each individual CAN make a difference\n- Rayan.sammut@gmail.com (2018-07-23): I\u2019ve got into the habit now of asking waiting staff not to put a straw in my drinks, but it doesn\u2019t always work. I\u2019m doing plastic free July and I have been brought a straw even after asking not to have one. What is the best way to deal with this? What do I do with the straw? In a different cafe they even brought me a cocktail stirrer with my soft drink, completely unnecessary and really frustrating when you ask for no straw only to get this in your drink.\n- Elanzeke@gmail.com (2018-07-25): I am starting a nonprofit on stopping plastic straw s going to be plasticstraw.org\n- drygel@aol.com (2018-07-28): Straws are not the major problem, they are a tiny problem when you consider the huge amounts of plastic being used every day. Plastic bags in Walmart, Target, Home Depot and other major retailers, add to it the plastic cups you get at Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts, McDonald\u2019s and all other huge stores that I don\u2019t have room to list here. Add to it the Plastic Plates and utensils and the large packaging materials, from Sam Clubs and Costco, when you buy 12 Apples that come in a plastic Clamshell huge Blister pack. All of the above are the 99.7% of the offender of the environment, So why are we so stupid to pick on Straws tha",
