  "readable_content": "- The article talks about a study published in Science Advances that reveals how a major ocean current is carrying plastic debris from the North Atlantic to the Greenland and Barents seas, thereby polluting the Arctic waters. The researchers believe that as climate change continues to shrink the Arctic sea ice cover, more human activity in the area will cause plastic pollution to spread further. This study draws attention to the growing issue of plastic pollution in the world's oceans and its potential impact on the Arctic region (The New York Times, 2017-04-19).",
