  "readable_content": "- tinker_toys (2023-12-08): Former Pep Boys tech here, now reformed and working at an independent.\n\nYour spark plugs are due at 75k, and if it were my car I'd do them around 70-80k, but they can probably run till 100k without a problem. You should use NGK Laser Iridium, the same plug the factory put in it. There is absolutely no benefit to be had from trying a different brand or a different type, but there is the potential for things to go wrong. Pep Boys sometimes likes to push Champion parts including plugs, because Champion and Pep are owned by the same company. Don't allow it.\n\nYour coolant is good for 10 years or 120k miles, whichever comes first. I would do it around 100k miles as preventive whatever, especially if it's possible it was ever topped off with a non-extended life coolant, but there's no strict need. It should also be done with the right coolant. I believe the Mazda extended coolant is green? But that doesn't mean it's the same as the standard green off-the-shelf coolant that PB would probably use.\n\nAnd finally, the 3-step. Unlike what other people have told you here, it's not just an air filter and/or a $5 bottle in the gas tank. It's a (mostly) complete \"fuel system cleaning.\" When I worked there, it involved cleaning the throttle body by hand, slowly running a cleaner through the intake manifold with the engine running to clean the manifold and intake valves, and, yes, a bottle in the gas tank to clean the injectors. The service is very profitable for the shop, of course, but it's also a good service that I do on my own cars every 30k or so. It usually won't fix anything, but it can have some preventive benefits. That service, plus an air filter, is worth $200 (edit: $100? even better but the following still applies) but only if it's done the way it should be. As a former Pep Boys tech in three different locations, I can tell you some people do it right, some people do it as fast as possible to check off the boxes. You're rolling the dice.\n\nAs a former Pep Boys tech, and current tech at an independent shop... my advice to you is actually to take it to a Mazda dealer around 90-100k. They'll be more than happy to do the work for you, and there's nearly no chance of them screwing it up or using the wrong parts.\n\n- amalik87 (2023-12-08): Cleaning the TB by hand? Some TB's could be a huge pain in the ass to get to.\n\n- slick62 (2023-12-08): Check your owner\u2019s manual for the requirements. I suspect the only thing you needed was oil and filter.\nPlugs at 75k, coolant at 120k. Air filter every 37.5k.\n\n- smorgenheckingaard (2023-12-08): This is called an upsell. Check the owners manual for service intervals. Chances are you don't need plugs (but maybe soon) and I'd bet money you don't need a coolant flush any time soon. Change your own air filter if it's dirty (for WAY less)\n\n- AdHocSpock (2023-12-08): Aw helll no!\n\n- alrashid2 (2023-12-08): Nope. None of it.\nThe plugs are most likely 75k to 100k mile interval. Check your owners manual. Regardless, plugs aren't a dire \"now or never\" repair. +/- 12k miles isn't going to hurt anything.\nCoolant interval should be 100k+ miles, so no there.\nNo damn clue what LBR is - googled it and pepboys came up haha. Sounds like bull. Your air filter is about $12 inside the pep boys store - replace it yourself. It's easier than grabbing a paper towel from the kitchen and cleaning up spilled ketchup. Seriously.\n\n- SteelSeoul8541 (2023-12-08): The LBR is Gumout, which is like $5 at Walmart lol.\nhttps://www.pepboys.com/auto-service-repair/fuel-system\n\n- larrymoencurly (2023-12-08): You don't need them at 65,000 miles:\nThe spark plugs are Iridium and Mazda says change them at 120,000 miles.\nYour antifreeze is Mazda FL-22 (may say so on the radiator cap), rated for 10 years or 120,000 miles before the 1st change, then 5 years or 60,000 miles after that. This antifreeze is dark green and sold only as premixed 50/50 or 55/45 antifreeze/water, but it's identical to Ford VC-10, which was developed with Mazda (Ford used to own almost 1/3 of Mazda), and that can be bought in 100% pure antifreeze form as VC-10-A2, about $25 a gallon. Be sure to add 40% to 50% distilled water to it because pure antifreeze can make an engine overheat and doesn't provide nearly as good freeze protection. On the other hand, never add water to premixed 50/50 antifreeze.\n\"3 Step Pro Fuel LBR\" also seems unnecessary. The gasoline additive they put into the fuel tank seems no different from a $10 bottle of Chevron Techron fuel/engine cleaner, and my Ford factory manual said modern fuel injectors are highly clog resistant and don't need routine cleaning, \"modern\" here being around 1992, and back then gasoline wasn't as good at preventing engine deposits as it is now. The intake valve cleaning they offer can help direct injection engines like Mazda SkyActiv (plastic engine cover will have blue on it), which can't clean their intake valves because no raw gasoline washes over them. However it seems SkyActiv engines don't have this problem as much as most direct injection engines because Mazda tried very hard to design theirs so those valves stay hot enough to not allow deposits to form on them.\nI have a feeling Pep Boys won't use factory approved antifreeze but will instead put in \"universal\" antifreeze, just as they don't use the factory transmission fluid a lot of times but just take common Dexron and add a small bottle of some chemical package from LubeGard, which doesn't result in fluid that's factory approved.\nSpark plugs last a long, long time because there's no lead in gasoline, the plug tips are made of platinum or iridium, which are highly resistant to erosion, and electronic ignition systems are a lot, lot better than the points ignitions in pre-1970s cars. Ignition systems greatly improved because air pollution laws essentially required them to be better.\nChanging the air filter isn't difficult, and if your Mazda has a 4-cylinder engine rather than a V-6, neither is changing the spark plugs.\n- SteelSeoul8541 (2023-12-08): Spark plugs should be changed every 75-100k miles (depending on which kind you get and chances are you still have the stock ones, which should still be good til 75k). Iridium plugs are the higher/top end and cost about $10-12 per plug. Labor can be annoying if they have to take off a fuel intake manifold. The only way it would cost $200 at a shop would be if you either have a 4cyl engine and they're giving you iridium plugs, or you have a 6cyl and they're giving you lower end plugs.\nCoolant exchange/flush is usually around 100k from my experience. Not sure on the cost.\n$100 for an AIR FILTER?! You can buy a K&N Performance filter for like $50-60 (which is on the expensive side, since you can get basic FRAM filters for $10-15) and throw it in yourself. It's usually just some clips or screws. I found what the 3 step LBR is. They literally throw GUMOUT in your gas tank and adjust the throttle IF necessary. At 64k, throttle adjustment shouldn't be necessary. GUMOUT is",
