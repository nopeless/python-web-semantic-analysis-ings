Eat actual veggies.\n\n- Jo_MamaSo (2016-04-19): They're basically different colored, different shaped Pringles.\n\n- catlover164 (2016-04-19): Try celery root french fries, zucchini chips, roasted radish chips, or turnip fries.\n\n- Mr_BoZipher (2016-04-19): I highly recommend not snacking at all. If you feel you need to snack, go for fruits or veggies.\n\n- frenchfrites (2016-04-19): They're very high in sodium. Choose a different snack.\n\n- [deleted] (2016-04-19): I like them as an alternative to chips.\n\n- Ammoholic (2016-04-19): They're mostly potato starch and flour. Much better options out there.",
