  "body": "Plastic waste migration to the ocean is a global issue, not at all created by one local group, and so I think looking at how it happens broadly (note many of those resources are from gov websites, so reasonably reliable) actually does address your point: which is a lack of knowledge about how waste like straws move from restaurants to the ocean.",
  "readable_content": "- redditminimalist (2016-12-08): This is good news\n- [deleted] (2016-12-08): I agree. The beaches on McNabs Island are littered with plastic straws. The birds, lobsters, and whales will all be thankful for a bit less plastic winding up in the ocean.\n- godplusplus (2016-12-08): It's a great step in the right direction. Hopefully soon they'll also stop using styrofoam containers for takeout.\n- [deleted] (2016-12-08): Now if we could just get them to stop putting a slice of lemon in my water we be getting somewhere.\n- ConanTroutman0 (2016-12-08): I'll happily take all the lemon slices you don't want.\n- [deleted] (2016-12-08): Why don't you ask for it without lemon?\n- EFCFrost (2016-12-08): I heard about this on the radio this morning. The DJ was like \"Some Halifax restaurants are taking plastic straws and coffee stir sticks off the menu.\" I was like good. I didn't feel like eating straws or stir sticks anyways.\n- [deleted] (2016-12-08): I like using straws when they give them to me at restaurants and bars, but I definitely wouldn't complain about places not using them. It's not something I ever think to buy for use at home.\n- meekotlarva (2016-12-08): When we went to the Rooftop (Stubborn Goat's patio) we were told that they are trying not to use straws, which we thought was a good thing...and then they served our meal with a plastic cutlery???\n- [deleted] (2016-12-08): I'm in favour of this, I never think to ask for a drink without a straw but I always take the straw out as soon as I get it. I always feel bad about using the piece of plastic and entirely wasting it\n- zigzinho (2016-12-08): The Stubborn Goat Gastropub, Durty Nelly's, Scanway, The Rooftop and The Stubborn Goat Beer Garden.... Aren't these businesses owned under the same umbrella? This article reads like an advertisement. Why aren't places like the 244 mentioned who take it a step further with wooden cutlery and recycled take-away containers? I swear that pay-for-placement advertising has infiltrated the CBC.\n- ManofManyTalentz (2016-12-08): Or..... Maybe one group is being a newsworthy pioneer\n- cache_invalidation (2016-12-08): I fondly remember sitting at a table in The 'New' Palace when a friend came back after walking around the place and drunkenly, but seriously, told us all to stop using the straws immediately. He had walked past one of the sinks where the staff dumped the leftover ice and straws from empty glasses, with water running from the tap, and surmised that they were washing the straws so they could use them again for the next customers.\n- stfnnlsn (2016-12-08): I'm not sure if I'm misunderstanding but it's pretty standard practice in bars/restaurants to have a \"dump bucket\" which catches ice, straws, citrus wedges etc so servers can quickly empty a glass to get it to the dishwasher. When it's time to change the bucket, you usually dump it into the sink (drains the ice, booze, water mixed in the bucket) and then you clean the solids out of the sink. It would be so much work to try to wash straws; even if they're cutting corners...this is more trouble than its worth.\n- Company13 (2016-12-08): It's fantastic that one group of restaurants owned by the same people in an article that makes them sound like separate restaurants are taking the straw initiative. They'll still carry straws for us people loving to drink 30% faster. What would be better is if the restaurants of Halifax put their weight behind foam and plastic recycling so that none of it goes to landfill. It's recyclable, make moulding from it!! The valley and Moncton recycle it all!\n- Scotianherb (2016-12-08): How much of this initiative is for the environment and how much of this is to save like $0.02 on an order?\n- tr0028 (2016-12-08): Does it matter?\n- Billybeegood (2016-12-08): The motivation is less important in the situation of a win-win",
