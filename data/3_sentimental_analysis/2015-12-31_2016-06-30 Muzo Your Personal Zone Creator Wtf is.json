  "body": "It creates an inverse wave of the sound it hears and sends it back, therefor cancelling out the biggerst part of the soundwave. This technique is quite old and can work like a charm. So, having 3-4 nodes around you in a room that create anti-sound, you can actually have a partually silent zone.",
  "readable_content": "- zoltecrules (2015-12-08): I think their webpage sums it up pretty nicely\n- TribeWars (2015-12-08): Maybe in a controlled environment and with only a single sound source. I.e No.\n- Illustrox1 (2015-12-08): Kickstarter and IGG are great places for aspiring sci-fi writers to get zany ideas, not so great for those easily fooled by marketing pitches.\n- _Xaver (2015-12-08): I am not very familiar with noise canceling technology, but as I understood their claims, their device works like this? external sound > device detects frequency/sound pattern and counter balances > sound gets \"muted\" by their device's \"counter sound-waves\". That only works for a constant sound pattern, right? Normal traffic noise and talking etc is way too much changing, so at the time that the device tries to annul the source sound you have already heard it. Am I on the right track here?\n- Amadeus_IOM (2015-12-08): Not buying it. Just check the description: \"Muzo is the first acoustic device that applies Anti-Vibration Technology for smooth surface. This Exclusive Technology prevents objects from vibrating to minimize any unwanted disturbances nearby. Besides, Muzo utilizes Billionsound Technology (Powered by BST) to generate dynamic realistic sounds. These vivid sounds set the scene and drown out intrusive noises.\"\n- UnlikelyPotato (2015-12-08): If you had multiple microphones, speakers, etc, you could mostly nullify sound around you by inverting the sound wave. However, this is just a single device. It doesn't know how far away you are from the device, or your direction. As such it would have to emit any noises in an omnidirectional manner. I'm assuming there's no way to calibrate your distance/angle from it. There's a good chance this would just make noises louder unless you were a perfect position away and the sound source opposite of the device.\n- mad_scientist_kyouma (2016-12-08): Just heard about this. I smell bullshit. Noise-cancelling headphones work by destructive interference of sound waves, i.e., they produce high pressure when the incoming sound wave has low pressure and vice versa. This can only work if you can ensure that both waves are always perfectly synchronized. The high pressure and low pressure have to hit your ear at the exact same time to cancel each other out. In headphones, the speaker is directly on your ear, so you know exactly how far the sound wave has to travel into your ear and how long that will take. BUT! When you have different sources of sound in unknown locations, and furthermore, it is unknown where exactly the listener is standing relative to the speaker which produces the \"counter-wave,\" there is no way to time this correctly. When you don't know where the listener is, and you don't know where your noise source is, there is absolutely no way that you can time a counter-wave such that it exactly cancels the noise when it enters the listener's ear! Even worse, when your timing is off, you might even create constructive interference. That means that your \"counter-wave\" has a high pressure point at the same time that your noise also has a high pressure point, and both add together to make the noise even louder! At best, this device could create a pattern of interference in your room, where you have destructive interference (silence) at some points, but constructive interference (even louder noise) in others. The pattern would look a bit like this: (link to image).\n- bmurphypdx (2016-12-08): Bose headphones have the best noise cancelling technology. They spend a ton of $$ on R&D. If this were possible, Bose would be there.\n- into_dust (2015-12-08): Pft. The Marshall, the resident science guy on Alias, invented that years ago. Standard spy technology years ago. :P (PS.: This sort of works in noise cancelling headphones but even then it only filters out specific sounds well and not perfectly. You still hear them, just less. Works great for droning engines on planes and in cars. Less so if someone around you is talking etc.)\n- imSLWU (2016-12-08): Let's say, hypothetically, that this thing actually works. How would it possibly differentiate sounds not to mute. You wouldn't be able to hear your conversational partner, or yourself, for that matter. There's no way this thing works, unless physics has changed since the last time I took it.\n- Hal_Nein_Thousand (2015-12-08): This is literally Sono from a few years ago. Went all over the Internet, then went quiet. Basically a design project. Even the original Dyson Award entry is no longer live, but there's an Archive.org snapshot available.\n- LlewynDavis1 (2015-12-08): So this is actually well funded. Can I just make up some bullshit and get this much money too?\n- skizmo (2015-12-08): Can I just make up some bullshit and get this much money too? Yes, actually you can. Look at the Skarp and Triton. The problem currently is that people simply want to believe that it is actually possible. So if somebody comes by and has a damn good pitch about a product, the belief system is starting to work. Take a look at religion... it is using the same system.\n- metroid085 (2016-12-08): Two thoughts on this: The promo video irks me. This guy's big annoyance is coming home to his fancy loft with his wife preparing dinner? What a jerk. As for the concept of this device, like others are saying it's very fishy. I've been acoustically treating a home studio recently and it's impressively difficult to control the way sound bounces around a room. The idea that a single device at a single point in a room could emit inverted sound waves that would cancel out any appreciable amount of ambient noise pollution is crazy. If you invert a track in any DAW it will cancel out its inverse. As a test, I can play the original track on my left monitor and its inverse on my right. The effect doesn't work. You hear both tracks together. This is the best case scenario for such a device because it's perfectly capturing, inverting, and reproducing the source. Yet it doesn't work at all.\n- jamesloong (2015-12-08): The traditional way is to actually create a prototype or proof of concept to get funding from investors. With this they just clearly even from their own comment says it's a theory. There is no working prototype. So I am calling this bs.\n- startupempire (2016-12-08): To be honest, it does look too good to be true. It would be great to have a review video to show off how the product works in a real-life environment instead of the beautifully shot product commercial.",
