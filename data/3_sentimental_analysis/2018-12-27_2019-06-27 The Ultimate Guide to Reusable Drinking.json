  "readable_content": "user (2023-12-08): Skip to content\nHome\nEco-Friendly Topics\nEverything Bamboo\nProducts Reviews\nArticles\nAbout\nContact\nJANUARY 17, 2019\nThe Ultimate Guide To Reusable Drinking Straws\nWanda Thompson\n\nWith a recent push to eliminate single-use plastic straws, there are now many reusable drinking straw options on the market. I\u2019ve done some research and tried several different types of reusable drinking straws and created this guide to help with your selection.\n\nWith so many different options, making a wise purchase can be overwhelming, so it definitely requires some research. After all, it would be a shame to buy a reusable straw and then have to toss it out because you are unhappy with it!\n\nI hope that this will give you some insight when making a decision for promoting a more sustainable and eco-friendly drinking straw option versus using single-use plastic straws.\n\nWhat to Look for in a Reusable Drinking Straw\n\nThere are many different materials that are used for reusable drinking straws. I\u2019m going to review each option along with the pros and cons according to the following features:\n\n- Durability \u2013 how long will this material last? Is it likely to break or wear down over time?\n- Eco-friendliness \u2013 how eco-friendly is this material? Does its production or disposal cause harm to the environment? Is it biodegradable or compostable?\n- Cleanliness \u2013 how easy are these straws to clean? Are they dishwasher safe?\n- Taste \u2013 how does the straw affect the taste of your drink?\n- Feel in mouth \u2013 how does the straw actually feel in your mouth? This may be one of the most important factors for some as you will be using this every day in your daily drinking routine.\n- Hot and cold conductivity \u2013 how does this straw react to hot or cold beverages?\n- Visual Appeal \u2013 what does this straw look like in your glass?\n- Cost \u2013 most reusable straws are sold in multipacks and contain added accessories.\n\nDifferent Types of Reusable Drinking Straws\n\nStainless Steel Straws\n- Durability \u2013 stainless steel is proven to be long-lasting material and can withstand dropping. Over time they might show signs of scratches and minor wear and tear.\n- Eco-friendliness \u2013 stainless steel is a recyclable material, you just need to find a local metal recycling facility. Since its a metal, stainless steel is not biodegradable. It\u2019s worth noting that steel is iron with all the carbon removed, in this process a coal-powered furnace is used. Coal can be harmful to human health and the environment. From an environmental impact standpoint, this may not be the most eco-friendly option. I have not yet found any stainless steel straws that are made from recyclable materials.\n- Cleanliness \u2013 these are dishwasher-safe and easy to clean and dry.\n- Taste \u2013 you may get the occasional metallic taste depending on what you are drinking. This may only be for the first few uses and will fade over time. I recommend giving your stainless steel straw a few solid washes before using.\n- Feel in mouth \u2013 stainless steel straws feel very smooth in the mouth. Some people complain that they don\u2019t like the feeling of metal clinking against their teeth. This is a personal preference for many. For the little ones, stainless steel is not a great option as children may be more prone to potentially chipping their teeth against the metal. Some brands even offer stainless steel straws with silicone tips around the mouth portion to prevent this.\n- Hot and cold conductivity \u2013 stainless steel straws will be very good conductors of both hot and cold liquids. This may not be the best option for drinking hot liquids as the steel will heat up and not be comfortable in your mouth.\n- Visual appeal \u2013 stainless steel straws have a great aesthetic appeal as they are shiny, \u00a0sleek, and eye-catching.\n- Cost \u2013 these are an affordable option that adds to their popularity. Prices range from $6-10 for a pack of 8, with different shapes and sizes. Included is usually a cleaning brush and carrying pouch. This is a great deal for those buying for large families!\n- Conclusion \u2013 stainless steel straws are one of the most popular options for reusable drinking straws and are sold by many brands. Its an extremely long-lasting and durable material but if you are searching for an all-natural and biodegradable option, stainless steel may not be the top winner.\n\nGlass Straws\n- Durability \u2013 a slight drawback is that glass is not so durable and can break or chip. Depending on the diameter and thickness of your straw, it may be more prone to breaking than others. Surprisingly enough, I have not experienced any breaking or chipping from my glass straws even after a couple of clumsy drops.\n- Eco-friendliness \u2013 many glass straws that are sold are made from tempered glass which is the same glass as Pyrex. Tempered glass is made from a chemical composition that gives the glass durability and heat resistance. Those chemicals prevent the glass from melting or breaking down making it unrecyclable. If recycled with other glass, it will damage the recycling machine and leave the entire batch of regular glass ruined. Most tempered glass ends up in landfills and will take many years to decompose.\n- Cleanliness \u2013 with glass being transparent, you can see exactly how clean your straw is on the inside. Glass is dishwasher-safe and dries very quickly.\n- Taste \u2013 you will not notice any extra taste when using a glass drinking straw.\n- Feel in mouth \u2013 glass straws feel very smooth and have a natural feel inside the mouth when using similar to drinking out of a glass.\n- Hot and cold conductivity \u2013 glass is a very good conductor of both hot and cold liquids. Since glass straws are made from tempered glass, they will be very resistant to heat, making it a great option for your hot liquids.\n- Visual appeal- glass straws are another material that is very aesthetically pleasing and will match along with any style drinking vessel you choose.\n- Cost \u2013 these can be on the more expensive side depending on the brand, ranging from $8-25 for a pack of 4 with a cleaning brush included.\n- Conclusion \u2013 glass straws are another very popular reusable option for many. I love how they look along with their functionality for both hot and cold liquids. As an eco-friendly material, I don\u2019t like how tempered glass straws cannot be recycled.\n\nBamboo Straws\n- Durability \u2013 bamboo is an incredibly durable material. Bamboo may show signs of cracking or splintering over time after many uses and washes. Treating them with coconut or food-grade mineral oil once a month will add to their lifespan.\n- Eco-friendliness \u2013 bamboo is a material known for its sustainability as a renewable resource. Bamboo is not recyclable but these straws are compostable and will decompose into the environment with some time.\n- Cleanliness \u2013 most bamboo straws are not dishwasher-safe and will require some extra soaking and careful drying before using again. They may change slightly in color around the part where you put your mouth.\n- Taste \u2013 bamboo can leave an earthy taste in the mouth when using depending on what you drink. I think they go well with smoothies or juices as this natural taste pairs well with fruits and vegetables.\n- Feel in mouth \u2013 some bamboo straws are finished with polish so they will have a smooth feel in the mouth. If there is no polish, you may notice a chalky texture once the straw gets moist.\n- Hot and cold conductivity \u2013 bamboo will not change temperature much, making it a great option for both hot and cold drinks.\n- Visual appeal \u2013 for some, bamboo may not be the most attractive looking drinking straw but has a very natural and organic look. I think they are really cool looking and add a tropical vacation vibe to my drink!\n- Cost \u2013 these are affordable straws that range from $8-12 for a multipack of 10 with a brush and a carrying pouch included.\n- Conclusion \u2013 A drawback to bamboo straws is that they may not last as long as stainless steel, silicone, or glass options. They will also require a bit of extra care and washing. Regardless of how well you care for them, they will require replacing at",
