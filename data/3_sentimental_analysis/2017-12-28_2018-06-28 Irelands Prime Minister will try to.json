  "readable_content": "- ChainsawAbortions (2018-03-14): Here comes Mike \u201cLike The Cock, Get The Shock\u201d Pence\n- Contemo (2018-03-14): Even the leftist site Snopes Shot this idea down\n- [deleted] (2018-03-14)\n- Kendle_C (2018-03-14): What sort of dark Celtic magic is this? Will he raise the issue in public? If so is it just an attempt to cause a negative reaction from the LGBT \"community\"? Will the conversation be private or will exchange be broadcast by the Prime Minister? What's the exact point of the exercise save that of just finding a new strategy at Trump bashing, division and conflict.\nHow does the opinion of either gentleman matter in the least except ripping the scab off wounds? I smell a rat.\nAlternatively, is the august Prime Minister just attempting to reinforce his constituency's support? Isn't this a form of meddling that shouldn't be permitted between sovereign nations? It's not fair to leverage such a visit for his own benefit at home.\nBesides, what good is such an announcement? It's like saying, \"I'm coming to your country to embarrass you. Let's talk, pal.\" Something stinks herein.",
