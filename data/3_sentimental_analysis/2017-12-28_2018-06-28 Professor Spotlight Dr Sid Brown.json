Photo courtesy of sewanee.edu.\nBy Luke Gair\nExecutive Staff\n\nAt the age of ten, Dr. Sid Brown strived for a career that young children often dream of: to be a cat. Today, it is clear she has certainly gone beyond the profession she had set before herself in her youth.\n- After earning her B.A. from Emory University in philosophy, she went on to attain her M.A. from Florida State University and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia, both in religious studies.\n- \u201cDepending on when I\u2019ve been asked over the years, I have answered the \u2018how I got into academics\u2019 question very differently because our stories change over time and different things take prominence.\u201d The first time Brown met a professor, she was enamored, seeing \u201chow deeply professors got to think about things.\u201d\n- \u201cWhen I fantasized about being a professor, in many ways that fantasy is a reality now. I get to teach in a lovely environment with excellent people, I get to try and do what I think is right.\u201d\n- There was a period of time in which she weaned off the path she previously set before herself, seriously considering no longer pursuing a career path as a professor, and instead working with bikes.\n- Another road considered was becoming a Buddhist nun, as she \u201chad spent time in nunneries and monasteries, and that life I was privileged enough to experience was very helpful to me and very lively. I thought I might be able to contribute there. In one storyline, I chose [professorship] the minute I met a professor, and in another story line I had to choose it.\u201d\n- Before coming to Sewanee, Brown was intrigued for both \u201cpersonal and professional\u201d reasons. \u201cI was working at a small liberal arts college in Iowa and I had chosen it because of the collegiality.\u201d She was surprised to see the \u201clevel of formalities\u201d in Sewanee\u2019s rituals. \u201cI was shocked by how seriously people took those rituals, even the students.\u201d\n- Alluding to the recent protests concerning the Board of Regents\u2019 decision to not revoke Charlie Rose\u2019s honorary degree, she loves \u201cthat aspect of Sewanee in that it can give a voice to people, not only when you perform the ritual.\u201d\n- She was often troubled by the large class sizes at the previous institution she taught at. \u201cWhen I went there, I was teaching 120 students a semester and I was teaching four classes a semester.\u201d With such a great amount of students to tend to, she worried that she would be unable to publish another book. After coming to Sewanee, the class sizes allowed her to get more acquainted with students, leading her to find it \u201cmuch more rewarding.\u201d From this, she also found more accommodating time for her to publish more books.\n- The rural environment also allowed her to delve deeper into her passion for biking. She commented that the \u201calto road is the steepest way to get back up the mountain, it\u2019s the way I get back up the mountain on my bike. This mountain has made this body.\u201d Being able to go on a bike ride around the farmland and rural landscape is a privilege for her, to ride her bike and not \u201cfear for her life,\u201d referencing the oncoming traffic one finds on busy city streets.\n- Her first book is a revision of her dissertation, titled The Journey of One Buddhist Nun. As an examination of one person\u2019s life, she deeply interviewed one person while living in a nunnery in Thailand, exploring as to why that person had chosen the life of a nun. She found that \u201cmaking friends with a person in a language that is not your first language is a fascinating thing.\u201d Since Brown became friends with her in Thai, \u201cparts of me that would normally come out didn\u2019t come out, and parts of me that never came out did.\u201d Her collection of essays, titled A Buddhist in the Classroom, explores how her \u201cown personal commitment to Buddhism\u201d informs her work in the classroom.\n- With a smile, she explains that \u201cit\u2019s not that I am interested in converting people, I am not. But it is true that my personal commitments play a role in how we do things in a classroom; it\u2019s not left at the door.\u201d\n- Brown\u2019s work is studied in classrooms all around the world. \u201cI thought when I published those books, I expected book reviews, and I got book reviews,\u201d she said. She did not expect so many people to reach out and talk to her as an author. To have her worked consumed on such a level seemed almost surreal. She stated \u201cpeople know me in a way that I do not know them.\u201d She has even had her work studied in Christian theology schools, a place she did not expect her work on Buddhism to be looked at.\n- \u201cI want to have had my oar in the water throughout my time as a professor. I am working for a number of different things that I think are important. I am working for social justice. Every day in my classroom, I am working for environmental justice. At the end, I hope to have kept rowing. I think it can be easy to stop and just sit back for the ride, and I don\u2019t want to do that. I want to engage and continue throughout. I hope I do that,\u201d Brown said.",
