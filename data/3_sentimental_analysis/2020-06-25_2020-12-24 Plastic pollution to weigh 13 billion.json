  "readable_content": "- BBC News (2023-12-08): Plastic pollution is projected to reach 1.3 billion tonnes by 2040 if no global action is taken, according to a study published in the journal Science. The researchers highlighted the need to reduce plastic production and consumption, substitute plastic with other materials, design products for recycling, improve waste collection rates in low-income countries, and support waste pickers. Even with feasible action, it's expected that 710 million extra tonnes of plastic waste will be in the environment in the next two decades. The study also emphasized the lack of proper waste management for an estimated 2 billion people in the Global South and the need to support waste pickers for a comprehensive solution.",
