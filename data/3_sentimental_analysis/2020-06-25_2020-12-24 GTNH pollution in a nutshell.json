I actually like the concept. Ever saw massive clouds of exhaust gases starting space rocket produces ? Yeah. Seems about right that it should do that. But i get how it might be not everyone cup of tea.\n- Houstonruss (2020-12-23): Real space rockets are incredibly clean burning, and the rockets in GTNH had pollution levels set by bart who is clueless as to how much 2/million gibbl/sec is. 28+ million pollution in one launch with no ways to fix it in game.\n- Tenebre55 (2020-12-23): Fun fact, that's actually steam, they basically flood the launch areas to prevent fires.\n- FormalPineapple (2020-12-23): Would you guys legit recommend GTNH? All these memes make me want to try it out\n    - [deleted] (2020-12-23): Sure, it's genuinely one of the best packs out there. Just be aware that it takes a lot of commitment and patience to get anywhere, and that it can easily take months to finish the pack, so you're in it for the long run.\n- DremsRevenge (2020-12-23): No. Like most gregtech packs instead of minimizing gregtechs problems(micro crafting, grind) It adds them to everything else. Anything fun takes irl months of pain to even get to. Sad because I LIKE gregtech but most packs that have gt decide to go full retard on \"expert mode\" bullshit",
