While paper and polylactic acid straws have gained increasing popularity in the beverage industry, there needs to be more investigation of the vital product properties determining their hedonic differences. This study systematically compared the properties of paper, polylactic acid and plastic straws, and their impacts on the consumer experience and willingness. Results showed that the open structure of paper straws prompted water penetration and absorption, reaching a water absorption of 30% after 10-min wetting, which might affect the taste of the drink. In contrast, the compact polymer matrices of polylactic acid straws prevented mass exchange in their use for drinking but retarded product biodegradation under natural conditions. Results of consumer testing showed that while the participants had a comparable liking of paper and polylactic acid straws to insert into a drink (i.e., 4.16 and 4.47 out of 5, respectively), the intrinsic difference was covered up by the open-ended capping for beverages. For the \u201cfully sealed on top\u201d dataset, paper straws dropped to 3.46, while that for polylactic acid straws remained at 4.70. Furthermore, a biodegradable straw easily inserted into a drink without fracture may positively prompt merchants\u2019 revenue. This study is expected to pave the way for the advancement and widespread use of bio-based products.",
  "summary": "The article provides a detailed comparison of paper, polylactic acid, and plastic straws and their impact on consumer experience and willingness. It highlights the potential benefits of biodegradable alternatives and emphasizes the importance of further research into the properties of these alternative materials. The overall tone seems to be supportive of the advancement and widespread use of bio-based products. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
