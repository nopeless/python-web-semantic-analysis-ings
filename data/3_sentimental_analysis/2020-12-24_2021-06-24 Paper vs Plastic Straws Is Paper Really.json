  "readable_content": "- Hugh (2019-07-09): In conclusion, just because some restaurants have switched over to paper straws, doesn\u2019t mean that you should use them. It\u2019s clear that paper straws are still harmful to the environment, even if plastic straws are more harmful.\n\nIn the end, paper straws still have large environmental consequences, and are definitely not eco-friendly. For the most part, they are still a single-use waste item.\n\nSo, what can you do to mitigate your environmental footprint?\n\nThe easiest way to reduce your environmental impact (in regards to straws) is to refuse all straws altogether.\n\nMake sure that whenever you go to restaurants, you request a drink without the straw. Restaurants usually give out straws automatically with your drink, so it\u2019s important that you ask before you order.",
