  "readable_content": "- MaterialUpender (2020-09-09): Unless you smoke as much as a habitual smoker, the worst thing for your computer's internals is... YOU.

Mostly skin cells, bits of hair, dust mites that live off that, and random stuff you brought into the house such as dirt, sand, and outdoor pollution. So 25 percent bits of you, and 75 percent stuff that you are unavoidably going to add just by being around. Burning incense every now and then likely is not going to contribute much to that muck.
