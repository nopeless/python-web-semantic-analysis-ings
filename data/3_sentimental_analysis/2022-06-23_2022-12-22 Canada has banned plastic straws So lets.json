  "readable_content": "- Bliggin (2022-12-08): Canada has banned plastic straws, so let\u2019s redefine oil and gas pipelines as \u201cplastic straws\u201d\n- cbbuntz (2022-12-08): It really is kind of silly when they put the blame on consumers for environmental impact while giving out $11 million per minute in oil subsidies\n- ZalmoxisRemembers (2022-12-08): Let\u2019s also valuate the costs of environmental and health care damages caused by oil companies and tax them in addition based off those costs.\n- Bliggin (2022-12-08): 7% of global GDP is spent on these kinds of direct and indirect subsidies. We only need to spend 2% to solve global warming.\n- Soundscape_Ambler (2022-12-08): Now my straw reaches across the room and starts to drink your milkshake. I... drink... your... milkshake. I drink it up!\n- Bliggin (2022-12-08): Haha!\n- fuckybitchyshitfuck (2022-12-08): Hey can we please do the infrastructure stuff BEFORE tearing down the pipelines? I still am forced to drive a gas car to get to and from work and I really can't afford for gas prices to skyrocket again before we have a reasonable alternative for people like me to commute to work.\n- Kindfarmboy (2022-12-08): I\u2019m down!\n- Bliggin (2022-12-08): You\u2019re my ride or die, Kindfarmboy. I\u2019m not doing this without you!\n- Faedala (2022-12-08): Ha ha\n- Bliggin (2022-12-08): Glad you got it. Not everyone seems to.\n- Ridley_Rohan (2022-12-08): The plastic straw thing is one of the dumbest things ever.\n- this1shard (2022-12-08): Donuts for Canadians-yes! Yes!\n- brandonjoncas (2022-12-08): The only way is to reduce demand\n- Bliggin (2022-12-08): Agreed. And that needs to be global in scope. Instead Canada is committed to having the worse climate record in the G7.",
