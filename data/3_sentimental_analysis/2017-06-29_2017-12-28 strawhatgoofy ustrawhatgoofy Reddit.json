  "body": "It's a shame that in a land full of samurai, all Oda did was prove Kuina completely correct about her dream to be a powerful swordswoman being impossible and pointless. There was a female samurai. She was a boss as well. Episode 1022 about 7:50 in for up front and center look but she's been around this whole time. 2.",

The movies are similar because the director, Sofia Coppola and Spike Jonze (Her) were married. So you are almost seeing two sides of the same story.\n\n- straw_hat_goofy (2022-12-08): Very very persistent romantic advances. So many movies have a guy chasing after a girl who clearly isn\u2019t interested but their persistence eventually wins them over.\n\n- straw_hat_goofy (2022-12-08): Hell yeah\n\n- straw_hat_goofy (2022-12-08): Thanks!! \ud83d\ude01\n\n- straw_hat_goofy (2022-12-08): That\u2019s me!!\n  - Edit: WOW!! Thanks for the awards guys! Was so happy to get a chance to interview her and I hope I get more opportunities like this one! Love this community!\n\n- straw_hat_goofy (2022-12-08): I've talked about this film a few months ago on Tiktok! It's one of this great films thats easy to miss.\n\n- straw_hat_goofy (2022-12-08): Personally I think movie nails the family dynamic, but meanders for a good chunk of the movie until the third act. It was part of the early wave of superhero movies so I think Fox just wanted us to Marvel at the fact that they had powers instead of story about people.\n\n- straw_hat_goofy (2022-12-08): With richly thematic films like Spider-man 1&2 and X-Men and X2 releasing only a few years prior, I could not fly with that",
