  "readable_content": "You will read a part of the text that is sourced from a website \"Forbes Vetted\" dated August 28, 2020.\n\n---\n**The 10 Best Reusable Straws For Sipping At Home Or On The Go**  \n*Ashley Abramson*  \nContributor  \nForbes Vetted  \n\nIf, like me, you\u2019ve been trying to be more environmentally conscious, you know that cutting back on single-use plastics (or not using them at all) is a good place to start. Maybe that means bringing tote bags to the grocery store or investing in a quality water bottle for hydrating on the go. Or maybe that means getting a few reusable straws so you never need another plastic one. Not only do reusable straws help to prevent plastic pollution, but cleaning and re-using them also decreases your waste output.  \n\nNot all reusable straws are created equal, though, and with the abundance of options \u2014 stainless steel, silicone and glass in all shapes and sizes \u2014 and user preferences (maybe you also hate the feeling of cold liquid in a metal straw), it can be tough to choose which will work best for you and your family. So I combed through tons of ratings and reviews to find all the different kinds of reusable straws users love most. From collapsible options that fit on your keychain to slow sip silicone ones for kids, here are our picks for the best reusable straws out there right now.\n\nHey!
