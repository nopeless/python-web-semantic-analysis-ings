  "body": "Straws themselves are nessesary (I have dysphagia due to a chronic illness, I can't drink without a straw) but plastic, single use straws are not nessesary.. I have a curved metal straw I carry with me so I can drink, and my brother who has the same illness has a durable plastic, reusable straw which will last ~5 years, has a bit more flexibility to it.",
  "readable_content": "- MaximumDestruction (2017-08-19): This may be true for many people but its not universally true. I have a friend with cerebral palsy, plastic bendy straws are a necessity for him.\n\n- [deleted] (2017-08-19): That was my first thought. Can be necessary for a lot of people from dentist patients and chronically ill to physically challenged people. But You don't need them ? Great, lucky you ! Definitely a item where you can avoid littering.\n\n- vocalfreesia (2017-08-19): When it comes to zero waste I would always say medical items are exempt. Diabetes test kits, medicine delivery etc are a perfect example of where single use plastics are so needed. 500 million straws a day for coke and cosmos not so much.\n\n- [deleted] (2017-08-19): I enjoy drinks with ice, but can't bear the ice touching my lips or teeth. Also, I'm a very absent minded klutz, so straws save a lot of accidents. That being said, I finally bought metal straws for home and love them. I haven't quite gotten the nerve to take them out and about with me. I have no idea why that's embarrassing.\n\n- [deleted] (2017-08-19): The biggest use case for straws is to keep as much sugary drink away from your teeth as possible.\n  \n- Everline (2017-08-19): Sugary drinks are not good for the teeth nor for the body in general, if you're concern for teeth hopefully you're concern for your body too. I don't see this being a concern if people don't drink that many sugar juice in the first place so in my mind it's not really a valid reason (I'm talking in general terms here, not for a small portion of population with actual medical needs which I don't believe can exclaim the large scale of straw use). But yeh at least there is reusable option.\n\n- akka-vodol (2017-08-19): I've never seen paper straws, but if they work well and are more sustainable, then sure they can replace the plastic ones. I'm not giving up straws though.\n\n- insightf (2017-08-19): I've used paper straws before but they get kinda soggy after not that long. I think metal straws are a better alternative but they're tricky to clean\n\n- ashdhan (2017-08-19): In Boulder, CO there's an organization dedicated to discouraging people and businesses from using straws. There are rumblings that it will become a ballot measure.\n\n- ryanmercer (2017-08-19): Happy cake-day!\n\n- technophila (2017-08-19): Haha. Thanks.\n\n- laikabake (2017-08-19): Totally with you. I have some very large glass straws that fit my 20 oz water bottle, a few small metal straws for regular glasses and we're getting paper straws for my wedding next summer (we're also getting sustainable and biodegradable plates and cutlery). No plastic necessary.\n\n- marieannfortynine (2017-08-19): Well I agree and have done for a long time. I hate straws and have never understood the reason for them. I have never bought any, of course part of that was the cost.I always considered buying throwaways a total waste of money.\n  \n- Spitinthacoola (2017-08-19): There are definitely use cases for straws.",
