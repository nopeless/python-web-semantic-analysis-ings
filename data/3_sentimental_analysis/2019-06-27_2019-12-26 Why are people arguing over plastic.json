  "readable_content": "Im_A_Epic_Giraffe (2019-11-06): Why are people arguing over plastic straws and metal straws when they could just drink straight out of the cup?\n- red_west_la: It\u2019s easier to use a straw if you\u2019re wearing lipstick\n- Coffee3Soup3: Also so your beard is not soaked in strange liquids\n- YellowFlySwat: I have sensitive teeth, and drinking cold drink from a glass isn't a fun experience for me.\n- y00sum: Because people like cups with caps so that it doesn't spill so easy. At least that's why I like them but thats only when your driving\n[deleted]\nChadamm: There are plenty of people who need a straw for a medical purpose.. shaky hands, weak muscles and muscle spasms are just some of the reasons.\njustreading31: How am I\u2019m going to drink my Carmel frappe with a 4 inch whipped cream topping? Unless I want a pie in face clown look I need some type of slurping device.\nTaurusteacups: You know when the ice clumps to the bottom of the cup and then, all the sudden, falls down and hits you in the face...maybe it's that.\n[deleted]\n[deleted]\npecklepuff: Someone who insisted on using straws told me once that they did so because the glass may be dirty, and they don't want to touch a dirty glass with their lips.\nI pointed out that if the glass is dirty, they are just drinking the dirt through the straw! Suffice it to say, I ruined their entire day. I mean how could that have not occurred to this person?\njasminel96: Lots of reasons.\nSpilling. Cups that aren\u2019t entirely clean (think restaurants- I\u2019d say this is more on the germaphobic side). Teeth sensitivity. Disabilities. To the people who mentioned water bottles - are you drinking a smoothie from a water bottle?\njaylovesyou2: I've always thought it was crazy, look how much plastic is used in packaging for simple products. A straw seems very small in comparison.\n- notsocoolnow: Because loads of fast food places give you paper or Styrofoam cups, meaning that drinking without a straw stands a good chance of ending up with your bra showing through your shirt.\nrandomMNguy98: Its easier to bypass braces with a straw than it is with fancy tongue work.\nDeathSpiral321: I'd like to know why people get upset about plastic straws, but still drink out of plastic cups? As if the straw plastic is more wasteful than the cup plastic.\n- arch_nyc: Cans. Ever stop to think how they\u2019re stored? The tops are filthy. Back when my office had canned drinks I always used straws.\n- [deleted]: Makes sense. When we were kids, we'd just find a garden hose somewhere and drink straight out of it lol\n- Scylinz: Boba",
