Disposable plastic straws have a terribly short lifespan of use, just minutes. Yet once discarded, they may persist as environmental pollution for hundreds of years, releasing microplastics and potentially threatening ecosystems. Still, straws are unlikely to go away anytime soon: consumers still crave their convenience, and they are necessary tools for people with limited mobility. Now, reporting in Advanced Functional Materials, a team led by Shu-Hong Yu has synthesized an edible cellulose-based straw that has potential to replace plastic.\n\n- Paper straws are an emerging commercial alternative to those made of plastic, but they have serious drawbacks to both consumers and corporations. They quickly become soggy in liquid despite waxy coatings, and often taste unpleasant, taking the joy out of drinking. They also cost a fair amount more than plastic straws: a single paper straw can cost about 4 cents to produce, whereas a plastic straw sits at around 0.2 cents. This difference adds up, especially for the restaurants and companies that buy them.\n\n- The research team was determined to develop a plastic-free straw made from natural, edible components that delivers a user experience comparable to that of plastic. Cellulose, a polysaccharide of repeating glucose units, is well known as a primary structural component of plant cell walls. Bacteria also biosynthesize a version of cellulose that is chemically purer, more crystalline and stronger than plant-derived cellulose, thanks to an ultrafine 3D network structure. \"We have been studying Gluconacetobacter xylinus to grow bacterial cellulose for about 10 years,\" says Yu, \"and we thought that bacterial cellulose would be an excellent raw material for making straws.\" The bacteria act as tiny synthetic factories, growing cellulose hydrogels that will later be processed into the straws.\n\n- However, a pure bacterial cellulose film on its own will swell in water, decreasing its strength in wet conditions. To improve the cellulose's mechanical properties and water resistance - vital for its application as a straw - the authors used an edible binder to seal the cellulose layers together. \"We wanted to avoid using petroleum-based binders, so we selected sodium alginate, an edible seaweed extract, and cross-linked it with food-grade calcium lactate,\" explains Qing-Fang Guan, one of the authors of the study.\n\n- The bacterial cellulose-based straws perform well compared with their commercial paper and plastic counterparts. Their flexural (or bend) strength is three times that of paper or plastic straws, and they are about twice as strong to compression. Wet flexural strength, a measure of how well the straw will hold up during drinking, is the real test - indeed, the cellulose straws are twice as strong as paper straws, even when the latter are protected with a hydrophobic layer. Cost is also expected to be much cheaper than paper straws: the authors estimate the manufacturing cost of their straws to be around 0.3 cents per straw, nearing that of plastic.\n\n- Ultimately, convenience items like straws will only be adopted if they are easy and enjoyable to use. The team is particularly excited that the straws are fully edible and that they can even be loaded with non-toxic pigments or flavour molecules to suit a variety of designs and tastes. \"The edible character provides a new ending of life for straws in addition to recycling or degradation,\" says Guan. But do not worry if you do not want to eat your straw: it can also degrade in soil.\n\n- The authors acknowledge that scaling up production of the straws is the next challenge. \"We will continue to study how to expand the production process of this straw, combine it with existing industrial production methods or develop equipment for mass production,\" reveals Yu. In the meantime, they are busy working on other challenges bacterial cellulose can solve in the food industry, such as disposable utensils and coatings.",
  "summary": "The post highlights the environmental issues associated with plastic straws and introduces a promising alternative in the form of edible cellulose-based straws. The authors emphasize the performance and cost benefits of these straws, while also addressing concerns related to consumer experience and disposal.
