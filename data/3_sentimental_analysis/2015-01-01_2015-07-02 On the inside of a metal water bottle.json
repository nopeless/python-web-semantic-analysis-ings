  "readable_content": "coolmandan03 (2014-02-02): On the inside of a metal water bottle - doesn't come out with soap or hot water. Water bottle has only been used for water\n\ngerryfleck: mineral deposits? Try throwing some white vinegar in there and let it sit before rinsing it out.\n\n- MrDorkESQ: It is probably a calcium/lime scale from hard water. Try filling it up with distilled vinegar and letting it soak for a day or two.\n\n- americanaluminium: If its aluminum, its probably a small amount of corrosion. I have had several aluminum bottles do this. If its stainless steel it may be lime build up from hard water.\n\n- IrekJanek: What kind of metal? Aluminum or stainless steel?\n\n- handfulofsounds: Maybe something something something vinegar\n\n- Leezardy: May be minerals from the water. If soaking it in 50/50 vinegar/water works, then it's that. Just rinse with plain water afterwards.",
