  "readable_content": "- ilovebeingthatguy (2019-07-15): Banning plastic straws is a complete farce disguised as taking care of the planet. It\u2019s marketed and praised as a remedy to a very real, and very serious problem. Everyday I see marketing for new products like reusable metal straws that you can keep right on your keychain. It\u2019s a complete money grab that in all honesty accomplishes nothing in relation to the problem at hand.\n- DiverGaming (2019-07-15): I agree, I literally got a paper straw on a movie last week, it broke after like 2 minutes. That was the last straw.\n    - ilovebeingthatguy (2019-07-15): Haha I really should have saw that punchline coming, quality pun my friend\n- maxwelldoug (2019-07-15): Just take the damn silver.\n- TheRover156 (2019-07-15): Yep! Environmentalism gets used like a marketing trend, and it has nothing to do with real care for the environment.\n    - ilovebeingthatguy (2019-07-15): Like don\u2019t get me wrong, taking steps in the right direction is important but to me this is just so transparent it\u2019ll make us gloss over the real contributing factors\n- Lolazaurus (2019-07-15): And if you disagree with their bullshit facade of a plan because you know it's just a way for them to make money and look like the \"good guys\" you get branded as some anti-environmentalist nutjob who denies climate change.\n- Gazhette (2019-07-15): Straws are very useless in the 99% of the cases... Do hoy want to drink something? Drink ir from the bottle/can/glass... Don't use a stupid plastic straw\n    - Onlymgtow88 (2019-07-15): How are this many typos possible sober.\n- R50cent (2019-07-15): Nah man. Non-reusable plastics are an issue. Look at the number of capped dumps on the planet full of plastic. there's nothing hyperbolic about it dude. And... to argue that a corporate interest would switch over from a non-reusable commodity to a reusable one as a \"money grab\" sure doesn't seem to follow any logic whatsoever, especially not the \"they're trying to get more money\" angle.\n- smackum_frackum13 (2019-07-15): Most of all the plastic in the ocean is just plastic fishing nets. Really, taking away plastic straws doesn't do crap\n- Exiled_From_Twitter (2019-07-15): It actually does help though. And how is it a money grab if the govt decides to ban plastic straws? Are those same members who made the decision also monetarily invested into reusable straw companies?\n- nojbro (2019-07-15): Big reusable straw bribed the government /s\n- Dazz316 (2019-07-15): The is no one single thing we can do. If you just want that one stop we take to fix this. You're going to be looking forever. Plastic straws are just one step. Plastic bags and plastic packaging are a step that's being taken in many places. Recycling. All sorts of steps are being taken and it adds up. And if you ask people to make all these changes at once it's just not going to work. It needs to be gradual. It's plastic straws one day and then plastic cups from McDonalds (that's the next one btw, not lids just the cups).\n- potatotub (2019-07-15): The main reason cited for eliminating plastic straws is their negative impact on our oceans and marine wildlife.\n    - ilovebeingthatguy (2019-07-15): Plastic = bad for the environment. Yes. Completely and categorically agree. Why don\u2019t we have the same movement and change in legislation to address the real roots of the problem. For example the meat and dairy industry. Or offshore oil drilling. Or fracking? The list goes on. There are countless things that can, and should be done, that can lead to progress. But I fear that people are buying these products and say \u201cwell I\u2019ve done my part\u201d and instead of making progress we\u2019re wasting time\n- [deleted] (2019-07-15): Well, it is a step in the right direction. Id rather see baby steps rather than no steps at all\n- Skiboyz2011 (2019-07-15): It\u2019s the same idea as the electric car movement, everyone thinks that driving a brand new electric car is how they\u2019re saving the environment, it\u2019s good don\u2019t get me wrong but, there is more of an impact caused when a new car is produced and manufactured than driving one moderately efficient car for a long period of time. The only thing we can do is to appreciate the effort and hope that it ripples more into mainstream culture, causes more people to think about their personal environmental footprint and could enact a change. - One of my professors of environmental studies started the class off by saying that \u201cif you want to be a true environmentalist and save the planet, you should kill yourself\u201d\n    - [deleted] (2019-07-15): iMnotHiigh (2019-07-15): It's funny, how California is all about Pollution, but is one of the most Polluted states in the country",
