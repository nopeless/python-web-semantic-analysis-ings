  "readable_content": "- organist101 (2021-12-08): AirPods 3 vs AirPods Pro? Which should I get?\n- needfulluyten (2021-12-08): Airpods Pro. Better all-around, 30% off too. Highly recommend Comply ear tips, made a massive difference in comfort + they really stay in my ears now.\n- throwthegarbageaway (2021-12-08): Hey man, I found your thread through google and I just wanted to chime in with my personal experience.\n- butterbuts (2021-12-08): My wife gave an early Christmas present 2 weeks ago in the form of AirPods 2. I loved the ease of use between my iPhone and iPad (I\u2019m new to apple, coming from android).\n- TheloniousPhunk (2021-12-08): Late to the party here so I\u2019m not sure if you made your purchase or not yet, but there are two main factors to consider about your purchase: Ear feel and ANC (active noise-cancelling). The actual monitors themselves are identical, so the base sound quality is the same between both pairs.\n- letraz (2021-12-08): Pro, with other ear tip\n- IntoTheMirror (2021-12-08): I find silicon tips really uncomfortable. Luckily, you can get a myriad of different foam tips for them that are a lot more comfortable. Like from Dekoni or Comply.\n- bigbootyguy (2021-12-08): Ordered both. As much as I enjoy pro. They hurt my right ear bones. Also. My call receivers notice my voice is worse and they hear more outdoor noise during calls from pro. I sound way better with 3.\n- Beanye (2021-12-08): Pro by far. Not sure how people prefer having their ear holding onto hard plastic over soft tips.\n- ZD_plguy17 (2021-12-08): I made switch from airpords 3 to Airpords Pro (1st gen). I can say this I perceived sound quality little better on regular airpords but they hold into my ear well, most noticably wider soundstage. But I prefer Airpods Pro for smooth fit and sealing so I can hear more details and less distraction from noise outside.\n- Puzzleheaded-Crow-74 (2021-12-08): By far? Seriously? You can\u2019t just speak for yourself and then generalize it. My girlfriend has the pros and I have the 3rd ones and I can tell you that the 3rd gen Airpods are more pleasing to listen to, sounds more dynamic with better soundstage. The pros also get your ears all sweaty and the tips all waxy, a problem that you don\u2019t have with the 3s. The only benefit the pros offer is the ANC and that\u2019s pretty much it.",
