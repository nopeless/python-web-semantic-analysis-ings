They also said that having clean drinking water is a privilege not a right. So yea, not surprised there.\n- dayafterpi (2021-12-08): its like they're sooo focused on that bottom line that they dont realize how stupid their greenwashing is.\n- taldarus (2021-12-08): I remember a time when plastic straws came in paper packaging.\n    - <deleted> (2021-12-08)\n\n        ---\n        Notice: The comment from <deleted> has been deleted.\n        ---\n\n- siouxze (2021-12-08): Next time don't buy nestle\n- piedpipr (2021-12-08): That itty bit of plastic is nothing. Not even in one gram of waste. Now consider\u2026 the carton\u2019s inner lining is made of Plastic. The machinery used to manufacture it is Plastic and Plastic waste. The transportation of the carton uses Plastic wrap and Plastic trays. The semi-truck uses petroleum fuel to ship it to the store. Finally, the disposal of the used carton uses Plastic trash bags. Removed by a petroleum-fueled garbage truck\u2026 etc etc\n    - <deleted> (2021-12-08)\n- siouxze (2021-12-08): Nestle ??? Dude it\u2019s * nestle\n- Danamaganza (2021-12-08): Just don\u2019t buy it.\n- Xikayu (2021-12-08): Is it not possible that this is cellophane?\n    - <deleted> (2021-12-08)\n- <deleted> (2021-12-08)\n    - <deleted> (2021-12-08)\n- bloodmusthaveblood (2021-12-08): They could just redesign the packaging to not require a straw.. like a milk carton\n- workaholic828 (2021-12-08): It\u2019s tough because they have to put the straw in something, you can\u2019t just let it hang.\n    - bloodmusthaveblood (2021-12-08): They could just get rid of the straw altogether and redesign the packaging to not require one\n- KuhlerTuep (2021-12-08): r/fucknestle\n- astromech_dj (2021-12-08): r/maliciouscompliance\n- JackDostoevsky (2021-12-08): this feels a little like splitting hairs: the entire beverage you're holding is a consumption nightmare. the plastic around the straw is probably the least destructive or polluting part of that entire drink. (don't forget, the cardboard material that had to make the box involved cutting down trees, and these things are usually lined with some sort of plastic on the inside, so it's not like the box is recyclable at all) instead of buying something that was produced thousands of miles from you, requiring a long chain of fossil-fuel driven logistics (and not to mention how * of a company Nestle is), maybe... opt for a different beverage? like a glass of water perhaps? you could at least buy something in an aluminum can, because aluminum is one of the most recyclable materials on the planet.",
