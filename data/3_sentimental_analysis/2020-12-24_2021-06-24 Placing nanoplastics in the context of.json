The release of plastic from many diffuse sources is anticipated to negatively impact the water quality of lakes, rivers and oceans as well as soil ecosystems, but our understanding of how particulate plastic behaves in different environmental compartments is still fragmentary. The dominant fraction of particulate plastic originates from the breakdown of macroplastic litter or is released during product use (for example, fibres from textiles or tyre wear)1, and conceptually there is no reason why plastic could not fragment further to the nanosize range. Indeed, this has already been shown to occur in laboratory experiments2,3. Therefore, it is difficult to disentangle the various facets of plastic pollution\u2014which could be considered as a continuum from macroplastics to microplastics to nanoplastics. However, it remains unclear whether nanoplastics can really simply be considered as an extension of the (micro)plastic problem, given that the difference in particle size may ultimately impart different interactions with organisms and fate and transport pathways, and that different analytical tools and skill sets are required to detect and characterize particles in this size range. Consequently, assessing the impacts of nanoplastics on environmental systems may be fundamentally different than assessing the impacts of macro- or microplastics.\n\nIncreasing focus is being given to nanoplastic particles, potentially because the word \u2018nano\u2019 itself is charged, because the small particle size conjures up an underlying discomfort with nanosized materials as a whole (for example, distrust in new nanotechnologies, potential for increased hazards with smaller particles), or because analysing nanomaterials is considered more of a scientific challenge (for example, more sophisticated tools and techniques are needed to study them). Both of these aspects have been observed before when assessing the environmental health and safety of engineered nanomaterials. But given the ubiquity of nanosized particles of natural origin or those unintentionally produced by human activity, for example, combustion by-products, it is unclear how nanoplastics fit into this picture as they constitute only one class of nanoparticulate material among many others of different origins. The experience gained with engineered nanomaterials may shed light on how to approach environmental nanoplastics research as many scientists have transitioned between these two disciplines. However, extrapolations between groups of nanomaterials with known specific toxic properties and modes of action can not necessarily be transferred one to one to the field of nanoplastics without careful considerations of particle chemistry, transport processes and toxicodynamics. At present, there is not enough information to perform a proper risk assessment of nanoplastics and thus there are key knowledge gaps that still must be filled in terms of both nanoplastic hazard and nanoplastic exposure. Ultimately, we hope to learn from previous experiences on how to assess human and environmental risks to nanosized materials, so that we can better place nanoplastics in context with global plastic pollution.\n\nIn this Perspective, we explore and discuss how the nanoplastics topic is perceived in the scientific community and society, the influencing factors that trigger research and public awareness to understand the consequences of nanoplastics pollution, and how we can avoid misleading or dead-end debates. In particular, we examine (1) the prominence of nanoplastics as an environmental contaminant of emerging concern, (2) the implications and challenges with defining nanoplastics, (3) the role of plastic size and chemistry in it's environmental fate and impacts in relation to other nanosized objects, (4) the increased attention by connecting the words \u2018plastic\u2019 and \u2018nano\u2019, and finally (5) the approaches we as responsible nanoscientists can take in providing evidenced-based assessments of nanoplastics in the context of global plastic pollution.",
  "summary": "The post discusses the growing concern about nanoplastics pollution and the need for research to understand its consequences. It also acknowledges the challenges in defining nanoplastics and emphasizes the importance of evidence-based assessments to address this environmental concern. Overall, the tone of the post is focused on the need for further research and understanding of nanoplastics in the context of global plastic pollution. \n\nSentiment: 0.5",
