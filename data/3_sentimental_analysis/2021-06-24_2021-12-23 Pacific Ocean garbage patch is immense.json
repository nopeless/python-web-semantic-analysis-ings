  "readable_content": "- BBC News (2023-12-08): Scientists have discovered marine animals living on plastic debris in an area of the open ocean dubbed \"the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.\" Many of the creatures are coastal species, living miles from their usual habitats, on a patch halfway between the coast of California and Hawaii. The study examined plastic items more than 5cm (2in) in diameter gathered from a gyre in the Pacific, and found plants and animals, including anemones, marine bugs, molluscs, and crabs on 90% of the debris. Scientists are concerned about plastic aiding the transport of invasive species, and highlighted the unintended consequence of plastic pollution. This discovery underscores a problem that is expected to grow, with an estimated 25,000 million tonnes of plastic waste being generated by 2050.\n\nDo you want to know more about this study or anything else?",
