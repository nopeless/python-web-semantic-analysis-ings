  "readable_content": "- Ba11er18 (2021-12-08): Where to buy good ballistic helmets?\n\n- [deleted] (2021-12-08): I saved up and got one from Team Wendy. I have their bump helmet as well.\n\n- TheStatusPoe (2021-12-08): ArmsUnlimited has an Ops-Core for $750\nhttps://www.armsunlimited.com/Ops-Core-FAST-SX-Ballistic-IIIA-Helmet-p/opscorefast-sx.htm\n\n- No-Pollution-2644 (2021-12-08): Hoplite < team wendy < opscore, outside of a used gentex these are the best/only good options. There are others that use proprietary interfaces like the revision vipers, but you may have a harder time accessorizing them. IMO a helmet and plates are two things you should never buy used, always new so you know what you're getting. I use the hoplite personally and love it.\n\n- [deleted] (2021-12-08): You can buy them from plenty of places, but it depends specifically on what you're looking for, Gentex/Ops Core, Team Wendy, Highcom, websites like Optactical and a few others stock them as well.\n\n- LutonFire (2021-12-08)\n\n- sunny8513 (2021-12-08)\n\n- Mactosin (2021-12-08): Primary arms had some ballistic helmets on sale yesterday. But I think they were team Wendy\u2019s.\n\n- spiritus_systems_guy (2021-12-08): MTEK Team wendy Opscore Surplus MCH ACH etc\n\n- Anthrax6nv (2021-12-08): Obscure and Team Wendy dominate for a reason. If you shoot left handed Team Wendy is the only good option, since they are the only company that makes a Left Eye Dominant (LED) chinstrap; all other companies put the giant plastic buckle at the very point you're trying to put your cheek on your rifle.",
