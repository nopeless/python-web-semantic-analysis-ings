  "readable_content": "User (2023-12-08): Skip to main content\n\nAndrew Forrest1,2* Luca Giacovazzi2 Sarah Dunlop1\u2020 Julia Reisser2,3 David Tickler1,2 Alan Jamieson4 Jessica J. Meeuwig1,3\n\n- Marine plastic pollution is a symptom of an inherently wasteful linear plastic economy, costing us more than US$ 2.2 trillion per year. Of the 6.3 billion tonnes of fossil fuel-derived plastic (FFP) waste produced to date, only 9% has been recycled; the rest being incinerated (12%) or dumped into the environment (79%). FFPs take centuries to degrade, meaning five billion tonnes of increasingly fragmented and dangerous plastics have accumulated in our oceans, soil and air.\n\nIntroduction\n\n- Plastics are a ubiquitous and persistent form of marine pollution with contamination levels rising drastically on beaches, the seafloor, and coastal and oceanic waters. The best available predictions suggest that with increasing mismanagement of fossil fuel-derived plastics, there will be one tonne of ocean plastic for every three tonnes of fish by 2025. The most visible impact of marine plastic pollution is its harm to marine megafauna including turtles, mammals, birds, and sharks, which ingest and become entangled in FFP with fatal consequences. Plastics' invasion of natural environments now appears complete, with contamination found from mountain tops and polar extremes to the remote depths of our oceans.\n\n- Plastics' fragmentation and dispersal as micro-particles may be the most insidious property of marine plastic pollution. FFPs contain dyes, flame retardants and plasticizers, some of which are persistent, bio-accumulative toxins. These compounds, along with water-borne pollutants absorbed into micro- and nanoplastics, can be transferred to organisms upon ingestion, contaminating them, their predators and potentially accumulating up food chains to human consumers of seafood.",
