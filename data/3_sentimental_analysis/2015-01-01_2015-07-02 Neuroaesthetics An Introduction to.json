  "readable_content": "user (2023-12-08): Neuroaesthetics is the study of how aesthetic perception, production, judgment, appreciation, and emotional response are produced and experienced from a neurobiological basis. This review explores proposed theories behind aesthetic processes in the brain and existing experimental research implicating neural substrates behind these theories, as well as the neurobiological basis of perception and interpretation of visual art.\n\n- Thomas S McClure and Jessica A Siegel delve into the study, discussing the visual system, visual reward, and the evolutionary theory of visual perception. They highlight examples of artistic manipulation of the two-stream hypothesis of visual processing and the influence of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) on aesthetic appreciation through transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Moreover, evolutionary theories rooted in survival govern human appreciation for landscape art.\n\nThis article, published in 2015, emphasizes the significance of these findings and serves as a foundation for the budding field of neuroaesthetics.",
