  "body": "Plastic straw bans kinda piss me off. I don't think they should be the default straw given to people, but I think they should be an option. I have a disability that affects my whole body, in addition to celiacs, and it makes it nearly impossible to drink without a straw, and other issues make non plastic straws a really bad choice for me.",
  "readable_content": "- Chatibo (2020-12-08): I went to a bar and since plastic straws have been banned and paper straws are awful, my cocktail had a pasta straw.\n- 666pool (2020-12-08): There was another thread about gluten in paper straws and this got brought up. I feel like if the bartender is handling a pasta straw after making each drink, there\u2019s going to be gluten cross-contamination all over that bar. I wouldn\u2019t feel safe ordering anything besides maybe a cider in a sales glass bottle.\n- [deleted] (2020-12-08): You could bring your own straws. They have silicone, bamboo, steel ones.\n- expert_amateuradvice (2020-12-08): Bamboo or grass straws are where it's at.\n- auggie235 (2020-12-08): Plastic straw bans kinda piss me off. I don't think they should be the default straw given to people, but I think they should be an option. I have a disability that affects my whole body, in addition to celiacs, and it makes it nearly impossible to drink without a straw, and other issues make non-plastic straws a really bad choice for me. I wish people would realize how much it alienated people with various disabilities and makes our life even more difficult.\n- Dovahkiinkv1 (2020-12-08): Paper straws also often have gluten in them.\n- [deleted] (2020-12-08): Plastic straws are banned?\n- FLPeach (2020-12-08): Paper straws are awkward to me, so I buy and use single-use plastic straws. I recycle enough plastic (paper, glass, and aluminum) to justify my purchase and use. I'm not giving up",
