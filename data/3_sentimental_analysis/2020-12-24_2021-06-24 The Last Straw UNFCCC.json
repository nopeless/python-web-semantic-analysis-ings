The report Plastic & Climate: The Hidden Costs of a Plastic Planet revealed that \"In 2019, the production and incineration of plastic will produce more than 850 million metric tons of greenhouse gases \u2013 equal to the emissions from 189 five-hundred-megawatt coal power plants.\" As the European Commission will ban a number of single-use plastics (including straws) in Europe from next month, the wheat straw is ready to take its place.\n\nThe social cooperative Staramaki, a combination of the Greek words for wheat (stari) and straw (kalamaki), was founded in 2019 in the northern Greek city of Kilkis, following an announcement the European Commission announcement regarding single-use plastics, highlighting the need for alternative, more sustainable options.\n\nFor Staramaki\u2019s co-founder, Stefanos Kamperis, the sustainable wheat straws they produce will hopefully replace the single-use plastic straw once and for all. This is the bedrock of their \"effort to revive the local economy and to give hope to us and to newcomers that want to settle in Kilkis, Greece.\"\n\nIn order to make its \"eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastic straws,\" Staramaki \"utilizes the by-product of local wheat cultivation,\" Stefanos says. Wheat is grown in local fields, before being hand harvested and hand selected. The stems are then cut by hand, boiled, rinsed and washed, before being dried and packaged to order.  So far Staramaki, which employs nine people, has produced more than one million straws.\n\nAt the same time, Staramaki provides \"employment opportunities for vulnerable groups of people and promotes social cohesion, as well as local and regional development.\"\n- user 2023-12-08: When the economic crisis hit Europe in 2008, something clicked for Stefanos. \"Having realised that the economic model that this world has been built upon, is leading us to the edge of the cliff, I decided to make profits for people other than investors or owners.\" Reshaping the way we perceive economic growth \u2013 moving towards a social and circular economy \u2013 is pivotal for a more social and climate resilient world, according to Stefanos.\n\nThe climate crisis has had severe impacts on Greece\u2019s economy and its people, but as Stefanos points out, climate change will not impact everybody to the same degree. \"Disproportionate impacts can occur where certain groups lack the social and economic resources necessary to relocate to avoid impacts, or to purchase the technology necessary to adapt to this climate change,\" Stefanos explains. \"Without proactive policies to address these equity concerns, climate change will likely reinforce and amplify current as well as future socioeconomic disparities, leaving low-income, minority, and politically marginalized groups with fewer economic opportunities and more environmental and health burdens.\"\n- user 2023-12-08: Stefanos has been involved with the refugee crisis for more than seven years, \"I witnessed the birth, rise and death of the infamous West Balkan route, taken by more than one million people searching for safety.\" Providing learning-based employment opportunities for those that want to settle in Kilkis is of vital importance for all vulnerable groups, as well as for Kilkis locals, where the current unemployment rate has reached 42 per cent. Everyone comes with \"new ideas to address major problems. Each person is formed by various realities, situations, truths, experiences,\" he adds. \"Staramaki tries to benefit from these different points of view and increase the level of creativity and innovation within.\" Fostering a safe place for everybody\u2019s voice to be heard is central to this. \"The many benefits of gender diversity are being reaped when we empower our people to reach and exceed their full potential.\"\n- user 2023-12-08: \"In a world of more than seven billion people, each of us is a drop in the bucket. But with enough drops, we can fill any bucket,\" Stefanos says. \"As individuals we need to learn to consume less, and [create less] waste, so that we can enjoy life more.\" \"Sharing, making, fixing, upcycling, repurposing and composting are all good places to start.\"\n- user 2023-12-08: As Staramaki exemplifies; creative, local and sustainable solutions can be found for everything if we work together \u2013 even for the notorious single use straw. For the vulnerable groups that Staramaki employs \u2013 including refugees whom we honour this World Refugee Day \u2013 the creation of a seemingly simple straw can be a life-changing opportunity.",
