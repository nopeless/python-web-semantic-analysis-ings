Humans are already eating plastic that they don\u2019t even know about, of course it\u2019s reaching a tipping point.\n\n- seejordan3 (2023-12-08): If you drink water from a plastic bottle for a year, you will have consumed 140,000 pieces of micro plastic. Drinking from the tap, 4,000. Fuck Nestle, Coke, and Pepsi.\n\n- vbcbandr (2023-12-08): Asking anyone with any sort of power to take drastic action on the environment is like asking them about their most shameful moment...they'll just smile, nod and walk away.\n\n- financequestionsacct (2023-12-08): I've been on City Council the past eight years and working my ass off to help in any way I can, but so far I haven't even gotten them all to agree to recognize Arbor Day.\n\n- Cranky_Windlass (2023-12-08): Considering the new information we gather everyday on microplastics, I would not be surprised if we're already past the point of no return.\n\n- QuantumForce7 (2023-12-08): What would a return even look like? Is the goal a plastic-free environment?\n\n- unoriginal_name_42 (2023-12-08): Pessimistic articles like this are trying to convince you that the fight over pollution is already lost so that you don't complain and they can keep making plastic because \"it's all fucked anyways\".\n\n- A-Cheeseburger (2023-12-08): Thank you for saying this. I\u2019m getting sick of these random, one off articles saying we\u2019ve messed ourselves up. I believe we can still fix things.\n\n- sinat50 (2023-12-08): I never see anybody mentioning how the fishing industry creates an overwhelming majority of plastics in the ocean.\n\n- whatsit578 (2023-12-08): Plastic pollution is messed up though. It upsets me how the plastics industry has essentially sold this idea of plastic recycling, when in reality almost none of the plastic from curbside collection ends up being recycled.\n\n- birkett83 (2023-12-08): Nature is a better engineer than we are... Give it enough time* and microbes will digest the lot.\n\n- FuriousJohn87 (2023-12-08): Every day it's a new tipping point with you people. Can't I just be depressed normally?\n\n- CapnTreee (2023-12-08): I love the \u201cMay\u201d part... They\u2019ve been finding microplastics in fetal blood. We\u2019re far past \u201cMay\u201d.",
