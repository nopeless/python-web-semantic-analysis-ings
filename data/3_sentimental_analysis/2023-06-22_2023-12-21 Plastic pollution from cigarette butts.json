  "readable_content": "- pgold05 (2023-12-08): Very cool example of health/environmental Economic research I saw posted over at r/science.\n\nThe researchers estimated that the annual economic cost of cigarette plastics waste is around US$26 billion, made up of US$20.7 billion in marine ecosystem damage and US$5 billion in waste management costs, adding up to US$186 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u201cAlthough this amount is small compared with the annual economic losses from tobacco (US$1.4 trillion per year) and may appear insignificant compared with the 8 million deaths attributable to tobacco each year, these environmental costs should not be downplayed as these are accumulating and are preventable,\u201d emphasises the researcher.\n\nPeople really undervalue the ability of economists to tackle environmental and health problems. Putting prices on externalities is critical to helping direct our free market society and allow us to make better decisions.\n\n- dually (2023-12-08): externality cost calculations are purely theoretical\n\n- freakinweasel353 (2023-12-08): Go back to the old Camel straights. No filter boy and girls. You know what you\u2019re doing will kill you. No point in slowing the process by a hazardous filter.\n\n- Haunting_Rain_3951 (2023-12-08): At this point just take the filters out. If you want to smoke then fine. Every study on the topic of smoking says it will eventually kill you. If that\u2019s your choice then let\u2019s not slow you down.\n\n- Alternative_Ask364 (2023-12-08): Would it be possible to make filters from non-plastic materials? Paper and activated charcoal filters have existed for decades.\n\n- 4score-7 (2023-12-08): What about the plastic pollution from pre packaged foods, so often filled with sugars, that are making people fatter in the western world? I see very few smokers anymore. They exist, but I don\u2019t see as many as once existed. But I see a whole lot more people carrying a lot, not a little, extra pounds on their bodies.\n\n- Motobugs (2023-12-08): There're still a lot. I work at a hospital in a big SE US cities. Lots of low income people still smokes. But my impression is very few smoke more than one pack per day. This is a very weird situation, considering the cigarettes are so expensive now.\n\n- the_boner_owner (2023-12-08): For there to be $26b in environmental costs per year, there must be a heck of a lot of cigarettes being smoked. Just because you don't see them doesn't mean it doesn't happen. Sure, sugars are bad too. This article is about cigarettes though\n\n- [deleted] (2023-12-08): <content hidden>\n\n- Alternative_Ask364 (2023-12-08): The average weight of each plastic filter is 3.4g. As cigarette butts are often littered along with plastic packaging, which weighs an average 19g for a standard pack size of 20 cigarettes, this was also included in the calculations.\n\nExcuse me but did they just suggest that a pack of cigarettes contains 87g of plastic? For comparison that\u2019s about as much plastic as two 2 liter bottles. Does that seem right to anyone here? Most cigarettes weigh less than a gram so it\u2019s an incredibly bold assumption to say that a single cigarette contains 3.4g of plastic. I don\u2019t smoke so I can\u2019t verify, but I\u2019d be surprised if an empty box of cigarettes weighs even close to 19 grams. How this study was allowed to see the light of day is embarrassing. I dislike smoking as much as the next person, but do we really need to start making up numbers and spreading lies in an attempt to make people dislike them more? Lying in an attempt to convince people to change their behaviors doesn\u2019t work.\n\n- pgold05 (2023-12-08): The number from the study comes from here, it is not made up. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.8b01533\n\nEDIT: Based on the equation and data from the linked source, it appears, to me, the weight is calculated on a per pack basis. I of course am not an author of the paper.\n\n- OneBlueberry3659 (2023-12-08): $26 billion times 10 years is not $186 billion. I\u2019m not gonna read the article and this is Reddit economics, so I\u2019m sure some asshole can explain this, not that I really care because I\u2019m not really vested in this planet or species anymore anyways\n\n- SwankyBriefs (2023-12-08): $26 billion times 10 years is not $186 billion. It is in today's dollars.",
