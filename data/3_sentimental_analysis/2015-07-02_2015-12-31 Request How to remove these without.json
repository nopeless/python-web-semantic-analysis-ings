Then bend them back into place, and the clasp will close normally. Edit: that's what some guy told me. I would never subvert a security device. MaximusNeo701. \u2022 8 yr. ago.",
  "readable_content": "- Ev_antics (2015-08-06): the whole design and point of those is to stop this from happening. You'd have to get your hands on the clasps they use to secure the bracelet so you could cut them and replace them as needed.\n\n- Lostner (2015-08-06): If you break your thumb it should slide fairly easily\n\n- moodog72 (2015-08-06): Dental pick and carefully bend each of the tabs (usually 6-8) back away from the button in the center. This takes some time, and usually 2 hands.\n\nThen bend them back into place, and the clasp will close normally.\n\nEdit: that's what some guy told me. I would never subvert a security device.\n\n- akiva23 (2015-08-06): If you're 21 with an id you can just get another one.\n\n- ExistentialThreat (2015-08-06): Cut it somewhere in the middle and use clear packing tape to hold it together. You would have to redo it each time, but it should get you past security :P\n\n- steeniekins (2015-08-06): I work at a hospital that uses ID bracelets with this similar design. Unfortunately, I think you're hooped. It's made to be a permanent thing. You can't remove it at will unless you have it loose and you slip the ID band off and on your wrist.\n\n- sardaukar022 (2015-08-06): Doesn't always work but sometimes you can use soap to get it to slip over your wrist.\n\n- [deleted] (2015-08-06): It's the band from the hospital, I want to be able to put this on and take it off at will without breaking it.\n\n- [deleted] (2015-08-06): Chop off your hand like the thief you are. The band will slip right off your wrist stump, no damage whatsoever.\n\n- PaletoBayPlayboy (2015-08-06): Might be a bit more involved than you're looking for but you could snip the existing clasp with wire cutters leaving the holes exposed. Then use something similar to these : http://www.amazon.com/Plastic-Package-Jewelry-Necklaces-Bracelets/dp/B00HQHSCZU/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&qid=1438883073&sr=8-11&keywords=plastic+bracelet+clasp\n\nThey would allow you remove and put back on.\n\n-  vysken (2015-08-06): Ooh okay, so I managed this twice on two bands I got from my holidays (although the 2nd one I did broke so it's not foolproof).\n\nIt's not ingenious or anything; just bite through it and it should pop off without causing too much damage. Unless it's super super tight then you're stuffed, try someone else's ideas. :D",
