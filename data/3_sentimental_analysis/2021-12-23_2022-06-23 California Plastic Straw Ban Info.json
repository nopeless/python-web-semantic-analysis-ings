  "readable_content": "-2023-12-08: In 2018, the Governor of California, Jerry Brown, signed Assembly Bill 1884 that banned the use of plastic straws. Although the ban had strong language aimed at banning plastic straws, the California legislature left the door open for people to continue using plastic straws.\n\nLet\u2019s go through the plastic straw ban, including what it covers, how California enforces the law, and what alternatives restaurants, bars, and other retailers have when it comes to plastic utensils.\n\nAccording to AB 1884, the law bans full-service bars and restaurants from automatically distributing plastic straws to their customers without the customer\u2019s request. If the customer requests a plastic straw, they may have as many as they request. The law creates a loophole for restaurants to continue serving plastic straws to their customers, as long as they\u2019re not a sit-down, full-service restaurant.\n\nThe California plastic straw ban was put in place two years after their ban on single-use plastic bags. California passed both of these laws to reduce plastic pollution. The law also allows cities to write unique laws concerning plastic straws. For example, cities like San Francisco, Monterey, and Malibu have full bans on plastic straws. The law has an enforcement mechanism as well, with fines for businesses that continue serving plastic straws.\n\nThe law only bans \u201csingle-use plastic straws,\u201d leaving various options, such as sugarcane straws, paper straws, metal straws, pasta straws, wood straws, and bamboo straws, as alternatives. Although most bars and restaurants switched to paper straws initially, paper straws have limitations and environmental concerns. The article suggests sugarcane straws as a biodegradable and more durable alternative that is environmentally responsible.\n\nSince plastic straws are a thing of the past in California, the article encourages business owners to use sugarcane straws that are 100% biodegradable, ensuring compliance with the law while being environmentally responsible.",
