  "readable_content": "-User- (2023-12-08): FAST FREE SHIPPING ON ORDERS OVER $300\n\nPaper Straws vs Plastic Straws: Should You Switch To Paper Straws?\n\nBy Anh Ha\n\nStraws are often assumed as being items of necessity, one it seems unimaginable to throw away entirely when so many enjoy using them. Even still, their traditional material has increasingly become known as a primary source of harm to the environment. Plastic straws are heartbreakingly found in the stomachs of sea animals and are responsible for clogging precious marine ecosystems.\u00a0\n\nThe good news? Paper straws can provide an eco-friendly alternative to their plastic counterparts. The debate of paper straws vs plastic straws has been raised time and time again among environmental enthusiasts. Which materials can save the earth, and do paper straws really make a difference? Let\u2019s discuss whether you should switch from using plastic straws to paper straws.\n\n-User- (2023-12-08): Why Are Plastic Straws Bad For The Environment?\n\nPlastic straws are one of the world's most commonly used and thrown-away items. Devastatingly, their convenience comes with a heavy price to our planet.\u00a0\n\nOn average, 500 million plastic straws are discarded daily in the US alone! Not only do plastic straws take hundreds of years to decompose, but their production and disposal continue to have damaging effects on our environment.\u00a0\n\nThe manufacturing of plastic straws requires non-renewable resources such as oil, natural gas, and harmful chemicals that dramatically pollute water sources and as a dire consequence, therefore increase their carbon footprint.\n\nAs if that weren\u2019t enough to change your mind, saddening statistics show the disposal or littering of these single-use straws results in them being washed away into oceans where marine life may consume or become entangled in them.\u00a0\n\n-User- (2023-12-08): Why Are Paper Straws Better Than Plastic Straws?\n\nPaper straws vs. plastic straws is a hot topic of discussion and controversy that has continued for some time now. But why do most people think paper straws are superior to the popular and widely used plastic ones? The answer lies in the two materials' sustainability levels and how they affect our environment.\u00a0\n\nFirst of all, paper straws are signific more biodegradable than their plastic counterparts. They break down easily and quickly, reducing their impact on the environment significantly. While plastic is made from non-renewable resources and can decompose for up to 500 years, paper straws can break down in less than three months when exposed to sunlight or water.\n\nThe second advantage of using paper over plastic is its safety level for animals and marine life. The danger of plastic stems from its ability to be ingested by animals, once it has broken into tiny pieces or has accumulated in the large masses we now find in our oceans called \u2018plastic islands\u2019.\u00a0 This is not a conceivable issue when discussing paper straws.",
