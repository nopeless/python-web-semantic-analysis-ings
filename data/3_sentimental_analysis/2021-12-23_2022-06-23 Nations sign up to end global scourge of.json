  "readable_content": "- UN News (2023-12-08): Heads of State, environment ministers, and other representatives from 175 nations endorsed a historic resolution at the UN Environment Assembly in Nairobi on Wednesday to end plastic pollution and forge an international legally binding agreement by the end of 2024. The resolution addresses the full life cycle of plastic, including its production, design, and disposal.\n\n- The resolution establishes an Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC) which will begin its work this year, aiming to complete a draft legally binding agreement by the end of 2024. This would reflect diverse alternatives to address the full life cycle of plastics, the design of reusable and recyclable products and materials, and the need for enhanced international collaboration.\n\n- The impacts of plastic production and pollution on climate change, nature loss, and pollution are significant, and the resolution aims to address these issues. Plastic pollution has been identified as a global industry valued at $522.6 billion, and its impact on the environment and human health is concerning. By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions associated with plastic production, use, and disposal could account for 15% of allowed emissions, under the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C in line with the Paris Agreement on climate change.\n\n- The historic resolution, entitled \u201cEnd Plastic Pollution: Towards an internationally legally binding instrument,\u201d was adopted with the conclusion of the three-day UNEA-5.2 meeting, attended by more than 3,400 in-person and 1,500 online participants from 175 UN Member States, including 79 ministers and 17 high-level officials.\n\n- Protecting nature at the core of SDGs: Deputy UN chief Amina Mohammed noted the theme of the UN Environment Assembly was based around \"Strengthening Actions for Nature to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals\u201d and highlighted the importance of protecting ecosystems to achieve the 2030 Agenda and the goals of the Paris Agreement.\n\n- The progress on a legally binding global agreement on plastic pollution provides \"a chance to truly make a difference\" showing the value of multilateralism, and Africa has led the way in addressing single-use plastics bags.\n\n- Participants celebrate the passage of the resolution at the UNEA-5.2 meeting.\n",
