  "readable_content": "- New_Fry (2022-12-08): 3rd straw down and still not finished with my smoothie.\n- Imbatmansidekick: Tis not a smoothie, that's a hardie\n- [deleted]: how hard do you suck\n- New_Fry: How much you paying?\n- justcyn: I found that with paper straws, it\u2019s the lid that causes the issues.

It\u2019s idiotic.\n- Great_Heavens99: Are u fighting with da straw?\n- Yontoryuu: If he was, I wonder what was the last straw that pushed him to do it.\n- xbubblegum_bitch: what da straw doing?\n- StereotypicalNerd666: Motherfucker are you eating the straw\n- SelectionAshamed7566: How the fuck do you drink your smoothie? Clenched fist style?",
