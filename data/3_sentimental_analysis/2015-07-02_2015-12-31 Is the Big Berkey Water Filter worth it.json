  "body": "It was fantastic. The water in Addis Ababa is the absolute worst-case scenario for microbes and impurities, and the Berkey did a phenomenal job. Paid for itself within a few months, because the alternative was buying bottled water constantly (and you could bet that those plastic bottles sat outside degrading in the sun and leeching chemicals).",
  "readable_content": "- buyitonce (2023-12-08): Is the Big Berkey Water Filter worth it?\n\n    - batsofburden: I have no answer for you, but I've been thinking of getting one too. I saw a few mentions of it on the website Apartment Therapy as well which were positive.\n\n    - geoffreygreene: I brought the smallest travel-size version to Ethiopia when I lived there for a few years. It was fantastic. The water in Addis Ababa is the absolute worst-case scenario for microbes and impurities, and the Berkey did a phenomenal job. Paid for itself within a few months, because the alternative was buying bottled water constantly.\n\n    - jmp242: I've used it and it's ... interesting. When I used it with water from our 3m filtered kitchen sink, the resulting water tasted horrible and was undrinkable. It's much better with water from an unfiltered source, though it still doesn't do the best taste filtering.\n\n    - buyitonce: Thank you for telling me about your experiences with the Big Berkey but now I'm a bit worried about your black goop problem. If it is in your water it might be a bacterial issue that could harm the health of your family and neighbors.\n\n    - iheartrms: My understanding is that RO filters much smaller particles but requires power and requires water to flush the membrane so there's water wasted. All depends on exactly what you are looking for.\n\n    - HerbHomebody: My Berkey has paid for itself many times over and turns hard water into delicious liquid. Before making the considerable investment in such an expensive filter I researched it long and hard and I know now that I could have saved lots of money if I had done it sooner. Go for it.\n\n    - beautifuljeep: Yes, it is fantastic! We never drank so much water before, actually crave it. Plus no fluoride... (I have kids).\n\n    - beat_attitudes: Only if you get the additional fluoride/arsenic filter.\n\n    - Poromenos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Hml1CL0Idk",
