  "readable_content": "Unknown User (2023-12-08): New interactive learning module explores The Starry Night.\n- Medium a Month: Plastic Straws\nTrue creativity is born out of constraint\u2014art made from plastic straws.\n\nOne way to cultivate creativity is to make art from the mundane. There is tremendous freedom in experimenting with a range of common everyday objects without any preconceived notions. Simply handle the media and reflect on, and then play up, its inherent characteristics. This month\u2019s medium is plastic straws.\n\nTrue creativity is born out of constraints. That is what I was thinking when I sought this month\u2019s medium. I wanted a medium that lacked historical and social significance. I also wanted a medium that seemed one dimensional with limited physical characteristics. My thinking was the fewer the associations and characteristics to draw on the greater the creative challenge. Plastic straws seemed to fit the bill. That is, until I studied the pieces created by artists who have worked with plastic straws.\n\nUsed once and then thrown away to decay incredibly slowly, some have used the drinking straw as a symbol of our disposable society. Others find inspiration in the straw's functionality and its ties to the mouth, sucking, and the sensual. Some have explored the creative potential of a single drinking straw, while others have employed tens of thousands in an individual piece. And while drinking straws are physically rigid, plastics have some unique qualities. Enjoy, you will never look at plastic straws the same way again.\n\nPatrick Martinez plays with the linearity and translucency of straws to create sculptures and installation that magically transform environments. His JIX connectors help you create your own.\n\nNestea Drinking Straw Sculpture, a cornerstone image in an advertising campaign by Publicis offers a literal reconceptualization of drinking straws.\n\nAnnie Varnot plays off the consumerist nature of drinking straws to create colorful pointillist sculptures.\n\nScott Jarvie\u2019s Clutch Chair plays off of drinking straws disposable nature while finding inspiration in the capillary structures of trees and other plant life.\n\nTara Donovan creates an undulating landscapes of plastic straws.\n\nEvan Blackwell builds on the stacking nature of plastic straws and the melting fusing nature of the thin plastic.\n\nFrancesca Pasquali creates straw mosaics that make the industrial look organic.\n\nSang-Sik Hong explores the sucking nature of the straw and related issues of sensuality and desire.\n\nTao\u2019s Drinking Straw creatures and insects reflects a popular Japanese craft trend.\n\nSince 1990, I have been exploring different forms of expression, including installation, sculpture, drawing, video, sound art, and product design. Through a wide range of media, I establish experimental structures to examine ideas about process, action, mobility, adaptation, and resistance. My work investigates the relationship between the object and its context of production and of presentation in order to challenge perception.\n\nIn November 2009, I founded the product design studio Blank Bubble. Blank Bubble is marked by a particular interest in dematerialization, meditative objects that offer sensory experiences, and reflects my concern for the notions of displacement, shift of perspective, and economy.\n\u2014 Patrick Martinez, see more examples at the JIX Gallery\n\nAlthough every one desires power, only a few of people can have it. Power is the symbol of strength and the object for one\u2019s wish since it accompanies many interests. Power is strong, scarce and heading toward eternity. However, the straw, contrary to the properties of power, is a weak structure, easily available to anyone. In addition, the plenty of straws constituting the lips in the work \u2018Sucking\u2019 tells the present progressive form of our desires that we have progressed in the past and will progress in the future.\n\u2014 Sang-Sik Hong from his artist statement\n\nMy investigations with materials address a specific trait that is unique to each material. I was particularly drawn to the scalloped edge on the paper plates. The structure and activity of spooling is what brought me to work with adding machine paper. The way the plastic cups absorb and diffuse light and, of course, their stackability, motivated me to use them for the project currently at Pace Wildenstein. In a sense, I develop a dialogue with each material that dictates the forms that develop. With every new material comes a specific repetitive action that builds the work; thus, I feel safe in saying I will be able to keep finding new methods of production.\n\u2014 Tara Donovan, in an interview with Oriane Stender also watch this video interview\n\nShare your links to other plastic straw-based art, and I will add them to the list. Or, add to the discussion by sharing images of your students\u2019 plastic straw-based explorations.\n\nNOTE: As the teacher, you will need to consider the benefits of when you share works by established artists. When shown early in the process, they can get the creative juices flowing, but they can also lead to self-censoring. Remember, the goal is not to create portfolio-worthy pieces, though that may happen. The goal is to practice thinking expansively and to become more artistically fluent, agile, and responsive.\n\nPlease share if you know others who create art made from plastic straws.",
