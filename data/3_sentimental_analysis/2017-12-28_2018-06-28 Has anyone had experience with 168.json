  "readable_content": "- lisakley34 (2017-12-08): Has anyone had experience with 16/8 fasting? Pros or cons??? Thanks\u2019\n  - DonsBirdie (2017-12-08): I've been doing it for a few months as well. My husband and I started, not for weight loss, but just because we read about some of the other benefits.\n  - suesiesunshine (2017-12-08): I\u2019ve been doing that for several months and I believe that it\u2019s helped reset my relationship with food to a much more healthy perspective.\n  - ruskayaprincessa (2017-12-08): I do this. While I haven\u2019t lost weight (I\u2019m at my target weight), my annual physical came back great.\n  - startledewe (2017-12-08): I started 16:8 5 days ago and I can honestly say I feel a difference in the \"why\" I eat.\n  - mcrouch824 (2017-12-08): I did it for the first time on Friday. I found that I wasn't really hungry even after my eating window opened so I ended up going 18 hours.\n  - song-of-misery (2017-12-08): My bf was the first one to get into it, he lost 40 lbs just by doing that. I started doing it in jan of this year, and i personally find that it has redefined my relationship with food.\n  - itchysensation03 (2017-12-08): I've combined 16/8 fasting with going to the gym immediately before the expiration of my fast (so I'm on an empty stomach), and I have felt better and more energized than ever.\n  - way2manyashleys (2017-12-08): IF 16:8 has seriously changed my life.\n  - ArePeaSee (2017-12-08): I lost 80 pounds in a year without fasting.\n  - ArePeaSee (2017-12-08): My friend fasted and she ended up heavier than ever.",
