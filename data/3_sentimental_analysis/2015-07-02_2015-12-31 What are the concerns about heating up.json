  "readable_content": "- Master_of_Fail (2015-09-25): None. There are almost zero concerns with heating plastic in the microwave. Nearly all plastics used for food prep and storage are microwave safe. If you're concerned double check the bottom of the container, most will say \"microwave safe\" or have a little picture of a microwave stamped on them. Everybody here uses plastic over glass because most of us take our food to work or school and plastic is lighter and less likely to break.\nHonestly, you're probably more likely to get food poisoning than you are to get sick from the plastics you're using. As always, handle anything you take out of the microwave carefully, the containers can get pretty hot.\n- toreadorable (2015-09-25): I absolutely love glass containers. Not because heating things up in plastic is bad, but because I just like glass. They are expensive and a huge pain in the ass but I love heating my food up in them. I still use plastic for cold foods.\n- little_Shepherd (2015-09-25): No sources (on mobile), but the thing about plastics is your food will leech estrogenic chemicals from them that can have harmful effects on your endocrine system over a long period of time. BPA had gotten some attention for this, but it's only one of thousands that do the same thing. And this is just one class of chemicals that we happen to know about. The industry lacks accountability and every chemical is assumed safe until proven otherwise, which is difficult to do for effects that are subtle and long term. Plastic isn't the only problem. We ingest and expose ourselves to countless manufactured chemicals everyday with no idea what effects they are really having. I just lost both of my parents to acute leukemia and brain cancer. They were 56 and 57. I think it's reasonable to assume this environment played a role in that. I'm not hardcore about limiting exposure, but I'm not blind to it. I think it's a good idea to limit your food's exposure to plastic. To each their own.\n- iceardor (2015-09-25): Plastics get scratched up, pitted, and crack easily over time. They're not designed to go through many reheat cycles. They require petroleum to make, and are more difficult to recycle than glass or metal.\n\n---\nI have excluded the redundant, unrelated information from the quoted text.
