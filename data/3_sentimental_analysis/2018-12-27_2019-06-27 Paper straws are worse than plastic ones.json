  "readable_content": "- [deleted] (2018-12-08):\n  Paper straws are worse than plastic ones\n  So, literally everywhere I live has banned plastic straws, and I think it's stupid, you put paper in your beverage, it gets soggy and your drink is ruined. Also, I found out that eating paper is bad for you. So everyone is saying the plastic goes on the ocean, but, I'm not putting it in the river, am I? I'm putting it in the bin. Worst case scenario it gets melted in an incinerator and a slight amount of chemicals gets in the air.\n\n  Archived post.

If the drink machines are self-serve I usually skip the top and straw n just sip from the cup. Even in my car drink tops are never really neccesary. By the time I'm driving ive taken a sip or two and its not at risk of spilling from regular driving. I'd even be in favor of sippy style cup tops to reduce the need for a separate top and straw.\n    - Ieatglues (2018-12-08):\n      PAPER STRAWS ARE ABSOLUTE GOD DAMN GARBAGE. EVERY F**KING TIME THEY TURN TO GOD DAMN MOTHERF**KING MUSH IN MY GOD DAMN DRINK AND THE FEELING IN MY MOUTH IS GOD DAMN HORRIBLE.\n    - easy_pie (2018-12-08):\n      You can add to that, that paper is significantly more energy, land and resource intensive to produce than equivalent plastic. Paper straws are literally worse for the environment than plastic ones\n    - AutoModerator (2018-12-08):\n      Moderator Announcement Read More \u00bb\n    - [deleted] (2018-12-08):\n      I can taste them right out of the package before they even get soggy, the texture sucks, and they aren\u2019t even that great for the environment. Trading ocean cleanliness for deforestation efforts; its a non starter.\n    - mafmaafmaaaf (2018-12-08):\n      The issue, for most businesses, where you get those paper straws from, is cost.\n\n      Simply put, paper straws are the cheapest alternatives to plastic straws. They didn\u2019t choose to make this switch - it was imposed on them by cities/states like Portland, Seattle or California.\n\n      To put it in perspective, compared to one plastic straw, the alternatives cost something like this: Paper (3x), Bamboo (20x), Silicone (60x), Stainless Steel (60x), and Glass (90x).\n\n      That\u2019s scary for procurement, and it feels very much like a chore to disburse additional funds. Which is why most restaurants/bars switch to paper. Also, another thing is that some people are dicks and steal stuff.\n\n      If you use paper, you can predict how many you use in a month. If you use metal, technically you shouldn\u2019t have to replace them, just like your cutlery. But that\u2019s an extra cost for little benefit.\n\n      Paper straws - look guys I care about the environment, come eat here. Stainless steel - same thing.",
