We get a shipment every week.\n\n[deleted] (2020-08-01)\n- I recently switched to metal and silicone straws. I\u2019ve accumulated quite the collection from fast food places that just hand them out with the food and I don\u2019t know what to do with all of them.\n\n[deleted] (2020-08-01)\n- They are banned in some countries. At this point is stupid to not switch to biodegradable ones.\n\nlilbums (2020-08-01)\n- Do some research and see if there's a more sustainable alternative.\n- I got my boyfriend's company to stop using black packaging for catering events (not recyclable where I am)\n\nmarie132m (2020-08-01)\n- Just wow",
