  "body": "Most takeout coffee cups are paper lined with a thin layer of plastic, making them neither compostable nor recyclable. Also PLA (compostable plastic) coffee cup lids are an option. Or at the very least the city could ban lids made from black plastic (black plastic is less recyclable than white or transparent plastic).",

Now you have to charge for them.\nI wonder how much money Walmart and Lablaws makes selling grocery bags for $0.05/ea?\n\n- [deleted] (2017-12-08):\n\n- [deleted] (2017-12-08):\n\n- Sophrosynic (2017-12-08): Business license holders in the city will be asked to choose one of the following operational models for single-use items: no distribution of disposable cups and plastic or paper shopping bags; charging a mandatory fee for disposable cups and plastic or paper shopping bags; or creating their own innovative option, such as incentives, discounts for customers who use reusable cups or bags, customer requests before distributing cups or bags, and loyalty programs for customers who bring their own reusable cups or bags. So basically, customer just has to ask and nothing will change.\n\n- ATemplatez (2017-12-08): They just said plastic straws. There are biodegradable straws made of paper.. And yes even bubble tea places have them.\n\n- donniemills (2017-12-08): Get on board Trudeau. We need a National ban on single use plastic.\n\n- [deleted] (2017-12-08): And you think our cost of living is high now? Nearly everything you buy comes in single use plastic.\n\n- [deleted] (2017-12-08):\n\n- Boogilywoo2 (2017-12-08): What happens if I\u2019m caught with a plastic straw? Is there a legal limit? What if I only have a few grams worth of straws?\n\n- Soory-MyBad (2017-12-08): I believe low capacity straws are still allowed, but if they have too many features, like a bendy neck, then they may still be prohibited.",
