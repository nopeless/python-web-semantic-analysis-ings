  "readable_content": "User (2023-12-08): I found an interesting article that discusses the discovery of wax worms being able to eat plastic. The article mentions that these worms can chew holes in a plastic shopping bag within 40 minutes. Scientists believe that the worms might have evolved a molecule to break down wax, and realized that this same molecule might also work on plastic. They determined that an enzyme in the worms or the bacteria living in and on their bodies was dissolving the plastic. This discovery has brought attention to the potential of using wax worms to help reduce plastic pollution.\n\n- This discovery is fascinating! It's amazing how nature can provide solutions to problems that we've created.",
