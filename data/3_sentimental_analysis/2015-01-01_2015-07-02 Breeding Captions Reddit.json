By contributing to r/breedingcaptions, you consent to all applicable rules and moderator decisions\n2. All posts must have breeding, reproduction or pregnancy as a core focus\n3.

All members must respect the stated & implied boundaries of other subreddit members\n6. All posts must provide value without expecting monetary or in-kind karma compensation\n\nTHE SUB IS BACK!\n\nThis sub is back and running after a brief hiatus. I'm going back cleaning things up, and will be moderating closely. I'm not planning to change much so most of the old rules still apply. All post must be breeding captions. I will accept caption requests, but they will be on a post by post basis. If there's any question about the request the post will be removed. I'm not big on banning people so if you are banned it's for a reason.\n\nI want this to be a place for everyone to delve into our breeding fantasies. Let's be open to all kinks, accepting of one another, and just have fun.\n\nDon't forget to report posts that aren't breeding captions or requests. Please don't report because you don't like or agree with the caption. That's not what the report feature is for. I also ask that you refrain from down voting unless it's actual spam. If you don't like the post just move on please.",
