  "body": "3. The Plastic-Eating Enzyme. One of the most important scientific solutions to plastic pollution that have emerged is the plastic-eating enzyme. In Japan 2016, a scientist discovered a plastic-eating enzyme that was capable of breaking down Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) - the most commonly used type of plastic.",
  "readable_content": "-User (2023-12-08): Plastic pollution is a significant issue with severe environmental consequences. I will present 10 scientific solutions to plastic pollution taken from an article.\n\nPlastic pollution is leaving behind impacts for generations to come. If our current rate of pollution continues, experts predict that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. It is clear that we need solutions to rectify this pressing issue. Thanks to innovation and research, scientists have been able to pioneer ground-breaking technology to help collect and prevent plastic pollution.\n\nPlastic pollution is one of the most pressing environmental issues the world faces today. As most of the plastics that we use don\u2019t break down and dissolve easily, it is slowly filling up our oceans, which will take centuries to disintegrate, posing tremendous issues for aquatic life, human health, and the marine ecosystem.\n\n**10 Scientific Solutions to Plastic Pollution**\n\n1. **The Ocean Clean-Up**: Developed by Dutch CEO Boyan Slat, this organization aims to clean up the Great Pacific Garbage Patch using a 600m-long floating structure to collect microplastics and transport them back to land for recycling.\n\n2. **NASA Satellite Technology**: NASA's technology can detect ocean plastic debris concentrations, which is crucial in tracking and managing plastic pollution.\n\n3. **The Plastic-Eating Enzyme**: Scientists in Japan discovered an enzyme called PETase that can break down the most commonly used plastic, Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). It helps in digesting plastic and modifying the molecular composition to speed up the breakdown process.\n\n4. **Plastic-Eating Mushrooms**: A species of fungus called Aspergillus Tubingensis has been found to degrade polyurethane (PU) and potentially provide biomaterials for different purposes.\n\n5. **Magnetic Coils**: Scientists have created a magnetic coil coated in nitrogen and a magnetic metal called manganese, which can target and break down microplastics in the ocean without harming marine life.\n\n6. **Converting to Fuel**: Australian company Licella Holdings has developed the Catalytic Hydrothermal Reactor (Cat-HTR) technology, which can convert unrecyclable plastic into oil through a pressure-cooker-like process, producing various materials that can be turned into plastic products or fuels.",
