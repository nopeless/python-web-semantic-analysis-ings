From bags and milk bottles to agriculture and transportation, plastic is everywhere, useful and convenient.\n\nBut we could be yet to realize the true cost of the synthetic behemoth we have created.\n\nBoth land and sea are affected by plastic waste, mainly because it is so durable. It isn't just large pieces that pose a threat, however - microplastics are amassing in colossal quantities, sometimes in parts of the ocean that have never been seen by humans before.\n\nMarine biologist and microplastics expert Dr Lucy Woodall is a scientific associate at the Museum.\n\nCurrently a researcher at the University of Oxford and Principal Scientist with Nekton, Lucy sheds light on just how deep our plastic problem is.\n\nThe plastic planet\n\nPlastic is everywhere, and the ocean is awash with it.\n\n- According to figures published in 2015, from the surface all the way down to the deep sea, a gargantuan eight million tonnes of plastic amasses each year.\n\n- Lucy says, 'These figures come from what we know goes to landfill, and what is known to go through other pathways - for example it gets burnt and recycled. We then assume that the rest of it ends up in the ocean.'\n\nScientists have been able to calculate the quantity of plastic in the ocean by extrapolating from the amount collected in nets during their studies of the surface.\n\n- 'It's relatively easy to see what is on the surface, but we don't know exactly what is floating mid-water or on the seabed,' says Lucy.\n\n- 'A lot of my research is looking at the seabed, but we don't have enough data to be able to estimate the figure there yet.'\n\nA threat to marine life\n\nMicroplastics, one aspect of the world's plastic problem, are pieces of plastic less than five millimeters in length, according to a universally accepted description from the USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\n- 'We have a maximum size, but there is no minimum limit - they can become small enough to be classed as nano, so when you can't see them anymore,' says Lucy.\n\nFrom the largest pieces to the unseen, plastic is affecting life in the deep blue.\n\n- Pollutants absorbed into plastic may negatively affect marine animals if they consume it.\n\n- 'You have the problems of ingestion and entanglement, but they can also be used for organisms to raft. Animals can use plastic as a conduit to get from one side of the ocean to the other.'\n\n- 'This is potentially damaging if you get something non-native coming in and thriving. We know invasive species are bad terrestrially, like in Australia with rabbits. Less is known about this in the ocean, although it is just as damaging. One well-known example of this is lionfish in the Caribbean.'\n\n- Plastic also has the ability to carry pathogenic microbes across the ocean, potentially impacting life as it travels.\n\n- It can also act like a sponge, pulling in other chemicals.\n\n- Studies have shown that this significantly increases the concentration of organic pollutants in an animal, compared with organisms that haven't eaten plastic.\n\nMunching on microplastics\n\nPlastic is virtually indestructible - a virtue which helped make the material such a commercial success. Aside from being incinerated, it is a problem that will almost never go away.\n\nLeft to itself, plastic will get infinitely smaller, but never fully disappear.\n\n- Plastic can continually fragment. It remains present in the ocean, even after the pieces become so small they cannot be seen without a microscope.\n\n- Lucy says, 'Microplastics are probably in every food we eat. They're in my cup of tea. I am breathing them in. We are exposed to them every day.\n\n- 'But even if we stopped all plastic from going into the environment tomorrow, we would probably see an increase in microplastics. This is because some plastics come into the ocean when they are small, but most of them degrade into fragments from other large items.'\n\nOne issue is that there are many products that are not commonly known to be made, at least in part, of plastic.\n\n- Lucy explains, 'Cigarette butts, babies' nappies, insulation - a lot of the products we make are made up of lots of different types of materials that are all connected together, so it's really difficult to break them up to recycle them.\n\n- 'This is a human made problem, and what we need to do is start stemming the sources.'\n\nThe microbead ban\n\nPlastics are now in parts of our oceans that humans have never seen.\n\nThis microbead image, taken using a scanning electron microscope, is about 0.5 millimeters wide. Plastic particles like this one (from a face wash) easily pass through sewage treatment plants and into the open ocean.\n\nRead more\n\nLucy says, 'For some of the places I go to as a researcher I am lucky enough to be the first human ever to see that bit of seabed, and I will still find bits of plastic.'\n\n- 'We need to think beyond clean-up. You cannot strain every bit of ocean, and even if we could, you would be getting rid of all the biology, making it useless.\n\n- 'We need to think about plastic before it gets into the ocean. We need to make sure there is appropriate waste management.\n\n- 'Then we need to look at what we do every day. We need to value plastic. We should be buying it, not just for the cost up to now, but actually buying it through to the end of its life.'\n\nAt the beginning of 2018, the long-awaited microbead ban came into effect in the UK, preventing companies from producing wash-off cosmetic products that contain plastic particles. Products that include these purposefully manufactured microplastics, such as exfoliating scrubs and toothpastes, were not purchasable from June 2018.\n\nAlthough this is a step in the right direction, it is not the end of the discussion on plastic use and waste.\n\n- 'Microbeads in cosmetics are a tiny, tiny proportion of all plastic. They account for less than 2% of microplastics in the ocean, and that is an even tinier proportion of our general plastic problem,' explains Lucy.\n\n- 'One-use plastic items and packaging are a much bigger problem. The next thing the government is",
  "summary": "The text discusses the significant issue of plastic pollution in the world's oceans and the detrimental impact it has on marine life. It highlights the pervasive nature of plastic, particularly microplastics, and emphasizes the importance of addressing the sources of plastic waste. The implementation of the microbead ban is acknowledged as a step in the right direction, but it is noted that this alone is not sufficient to address the broader plastic problem. Overall, the text conveys a sense of urgency and the need for comprehensive solutions to tackle the plastic crisis. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
