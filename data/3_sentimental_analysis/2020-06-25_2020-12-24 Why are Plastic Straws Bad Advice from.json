Advice from the Experts**\nSeptember 30, 2020\n\nRestaurants and cafes are cutting down. Cities and countries around the world are banning them outright. And, increasingly, conscientious consumers are demanding change.\n\nWe\u2019re heading to 2021 and the crusade against plastic straws is in full swing. Vive la r\u00e9volution.\n\nBut what has led us to this point? Why are plastic straws so bad that we want to eradicate them? To answer that, we\u2019ve scoured the internet for expert insight and advice to learn how and why these single-use straws are damaging the ocean, the environment, and our health.\n\n**Why are plastic straws bad for the ocean?**\n\n\u201cBecause plastic has a lifecycle that extends long after it\u2019s served any function, single-use products often wind up in landfills or, even worse, the ocean.\u201d - Kristin Hunt, Senior Editor at Green Matters (Source)\n\nThe problem with plastic is that it doesn\u2019t biodegrade, meaning it cannot decompose and return to nature. Instead, it breaks down into much smaller pieces, called \u201cmicroplastics\u201d \u2014 and these pose a significant threat to the health and wellbeing of marine life when dumped in the ocean.\n\nAccording to StrawlessOcean.org, turtles and seabirds have been found with plastic in their stomachs. A study published by PNAS, meanwhile, projects that by 2050, 99% of seabirds will have ingested plastic. And globally, 100,000 marine mammals die as by 2025.\n\nAmong this waste is an abundance of plastic straws, firmly in the top 10 items polluting our oceans.\n\nWriting in the Guardian, Hannah Lownsbrough, executive director of global consumer group SumOfUs, highlights the scale of the problem, with 500 million plastic straws being used daily by Americans alone.\n\n**Why are plastic straws bad for the environment?**\n\n\u201cThey create what we call microplastics. We're finding these flecks of plastic in everything from the forage fish that are at the base of the food web up through the kinds of fish that we end up putting on our dinner plate.\u201d - George Leonard, Chief Scientist for the Ocean Conservancy (Source)\n\nPlastic is a robust material. It\u2019s popular in manufacturing because it\u2019s durable, mouldable, and versatile.\n\nYet, this durability is also its biggest flaw when it comes to environmental impact.\n\nAs we mentioned before, plastic isn\u2019t biodegradable. And although it may break down into smaller pieces, those pieces don\u2019t fully decompose, meaning they remain in our environment for possibly even thousands of years.\n\n**Why are plastic straws bad for our health?**\n\n\u201cPlastics in general pose a major threat to health by leaching endocrine disruptors (chemicals that interfere with your hormones).\u201d - Dr Jolene Brighten, founder of Rubus Health (Source)\n\nIt\u2019s not just chemical-absorbing microplastics that are a concern; plastic straws contain chemicals themselves.\n\nThe straws are typically made using polypropylene, a type of plastic made from petroleum. And although the FDA has found this to be food-safe, chemicals from the plastic could leach into liquids, releasing compounds which may affect estrogen levels.\n\n- **Follow our updates**\n- McDonald's Canada will introduce paper straws at more than 1400 restaurants October 8, 2021\n- War on plastic: English government to ban single use plastics August 30, 2021\n- Tembo supports European standards for Paper Straws April 8, 2021\n\n- **SUBSCRIBE TO OUR UPDATES**\n- **Meet our Business Representative**\n- **Industrial Paper Straw Machines and Supply**\n- Martin Grandjean\n- + 44 7899 993595\n- marketing@tembo.eu\n\n- **Job openings at Tembo Paper**\n- *There are no vacancies to show.*\n- **SEE ALL VACANCIES AT TEMBO**\n- **Contact Tembo Paper**\n- Tembo Paper B.V.\n- Constructieweg 45\n- 8263 BC Kampen\n- Postbus 126\n- 8260 AC Kampen\n- The Netherlands\n- Tel: +31 383766244\n\n- **About Tembo Paper**\n- Tembo Paper is the result of combined brainpower of our Tembo companies.
