  "readable_content": "- crawwll (2016-12-08): What is the name of the pink sex toy that I see in many videos and a lot of cams? It just looks like a pink string hanging out of their butthole, but they seem to enjoy it a lot.\n- only7inches (2016-12-08): The Lush by Lovense, a Bluetooth, remote control, and/or sound controlled vibrator.\n- LanaCalrisian (2016-12-08): It also should definitely not be used in the butt hole. That's almost asking to lose it. I have one it's great, but if a girl puts it in her booty she is not very intelligent.\n- Znuff (2016-12-08): They put it up their ass constantly. There's a very low risk of actually losing it, considering how long it is...\n- Ok_Thanks_6343 (7 months ago): So what's it called\n- HavTungWilTravl (2016-12-08): If it's got a string, or a ring on it, is it just ordinary anal beads?\n- JohnnyWildee (1 year ago): I\u2019ve been also trying to find the name of this toy for a while cause I\u2019m also super curious. It\u2019s not the Lush",
