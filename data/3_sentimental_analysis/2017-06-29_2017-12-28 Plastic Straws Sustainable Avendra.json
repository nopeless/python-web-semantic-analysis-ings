  "readable_content": "user (2023-12-08): Plastic Straws: Sustainable?\n\nPlastic straws are expected to be the next biggest sustainability concern in foodservice disposables. As a nation, it is estimated that we go through 500 million straws a day which, at best, wind up in the landfill. At worst, they end up in rivers, streams, and oceans where they can be ingested by wildlife and marine mammals.\n\nStraws are almost exclusively made of polypropylene, which is one of the most sustainable plastics, but because straws are so small and lightweight, they are rarely recycled even if they make it into a recycle bin.\n\nWhat are the Alternatives?\n- Paper and PLA (bio-resin/compostable) straws are available as alternatives to plastic straws. Paper straws, however, are more expensive and have a heavier carbon footprint than do plastic straws. PLA straws are compostable but only in commercial composters \u2013 so there is still a significant chance they will still wind up in landfills or in waterways and oceans where they will not degrade, making them problematic still. Wood and metal non-disposable straws are also available, although they\u2019re hard to clean and aren\u2019t good solutions for the foodservice industry.\n\nGood News, Though!\n- With straws, we can enact the most sustainable choice of all: Reduce Use. Consumers are already seeing \u201cno straw\u201d policies at many zoos, aquariums, parks and universities, in addition to bars and restaurants that are only providing straws if requested.\n\nThe city of Seattle has an ordinance to ban disposable plastics for foodservice establishments. \u201cAs of July 1, 2018, food services businesses should not be providing plastic straws or utensils,\u201d Seattle Public Utilities\u2019 Strategic Adviser for Product Stewardship, Sego Jackson, said. \u201cWhat they should be providing are compostable straws or compostable utensils. But they also might be providing durables, reusables, or encouraging you to skip the straw altogether.\u201d\n\nWhat Can I Do?\n- You can start by supplying straws only when guests request them. While there will still be some straw use, the number of straws being thrown out will drop significantly. You can use informative messaging to convey to guests that while straws are available, they can participate in sustainable practices by choosing to \u201cskip the straw.\u201d\u00a0 Some education will be necessary to ensure that your guests feel that it\u2019s their choice, rather than something being imposed upon them.\n\nWe understand that there will still be a need for straws \u2013 some customers feel it\u2019s more sanitary. Straws may also be needed to prevent spills \u2014 consider children just learning to drink from a cup or people with physical impairments.\n\nOnce you\u2019ve put an \u201cupon request only\u201d program in place, decide what\u2019s the best straw to use. If you\u2019re composting foodservice disposables with a commercial composter, and there\u2019s little to no chance that straws will escape the waste stream and get into waterways, then a PLA compostable straw would be the best choice. If you\u2019re not composting your disposables, and your goal is to present the most sustainable solution possible, then a paper straw might be your best choice. If your goal is to choose products with the best value, then a plastic straw, on request only, will be the best-priced choice.",
