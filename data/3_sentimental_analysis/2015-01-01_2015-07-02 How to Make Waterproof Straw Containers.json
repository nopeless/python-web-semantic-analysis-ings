If you're storing matches its best to make it a bit longer and add some cotton to the bottom to prevent moisture build up.\n2. Ask the matches, cut a thin strip of phosphorus off the matchbox and slide it in with them.\n3. In regards to all asking how to open them, just pinch the pointed sides of the fused plastic. It's weak as hell and should give at some point. All if else fails, use your teeth\n\n- jeepgirlscozycrafts (2019-12-08): Loved these for my 1 night hiking/camping trips very light and easy to carry in and out. Also the money is perfect to stash $20 for emergency and keep it in my wallet for EDC and not be tempted to open and use it lol\n\n- RealQuickChris (2016-12-08): Great video. I put these mini straw kits in all my bags, bottles and tins. They are great.  OMG I forgot you can get honey with a tip that's so much easier. Your videos are awesome keep them coming.\n\n- dawnwilliams8417 (2021-12-08): I found printing the contents in a easy to read font and tapping over the entire label with clear tape works very well.\n\n- Waterflame (2015-12-08): I love this idea! I will probably never do it, since it's so time consuming, but I enjoyed watching your video! :)\n\n- YenieD13 (2021-12-08): Love this! Going to also use this for single dose meds for our camping trips.",
