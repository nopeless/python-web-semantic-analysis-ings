It\u2019s not one of those use-it-once-and-toss-it-away plastic straws that lives for 200 years in a landfill. The straw is called phade and promises sipping that\u2019s not subpar. Dunkin\u2019 has adopted the brand and is giving out phade drinking straws at select stores.\n\nThe phade is dubbed as a \u201cbreakthrough marine biodegradable drinking straw\u201d made with a substrate derived from canola oil, aka PHA or polyhydroxyalkanoate. The straw is compostable in home and industrial environments, its makers say, but still has that \u201cfeel and user experience of a traditional plastic straw.\u201d\n\nBesides Dunkin\u2019, the phade is currently offered by more than 60 distributors in the U.S. and sold at Walmart.\n\n\u201cWe have serious recycling challenges to overcome, but we need solutions right now,\u201d Laporte says. \u201cAgain, phade is a solution. It is designed with natural elements with the intention to return to nature quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe straw attracts microorganisms that help it break down quickly in bacteria-rich environments,\u201d Laporte explains. That means phade straws can go into your home compost pile or your trash can. And if the straw somehow ends up in the ocean, it\u2019ll break down there too.\n\n-Editorial Note: This article was originally published on Jan 18, 2021.",
