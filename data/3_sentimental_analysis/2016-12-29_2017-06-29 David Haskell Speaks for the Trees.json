Paul Kvinta meets with the real-life Lorax on New York's Upper West side and learns why white men never stand in the shade.\n\n- **7:03 p.m.**\n    - An attractive blonde in a short skirt walking three terriers stops under the tree to untangle her leashes. I focus on the woman. Haskell focuses on the dogs. One white puffball \u00adrefuses to budge when the woman prepares to resume walking. She coaxes the dog. She jerks the leash. \u201cHe\u2019s saying, \u2018This is a cool tree,\u2019 \u201d Haskell says, meaning literally cool. She\u2019s not hearing him. The woman drags the pooch off down the sidewalk.\u00a0\n\n    - Haskell strides over to the tree, bends down, and touches the pavement. \u201cFeel that,\u201d he tells me. The sidewalk is cool, despite temperatures in the nineties. We then walk out to the median in the middle of Broadway and feel the shade-free pavement there. It\u2019s a good 20 degrees hotter than under the tree. \u201cOn aver\u00adage, it\u2019s seven degrees warmer in New York City than it is just outside the city, partly because of all these hard surfaces absorbing heat,\u201d he says. \u201cBut trees change the weather in a city. They have a significant cooling effect. They save a lot on air-conditioning.\u201d\u00a0\n\n    - **7:06 p.m.**\n        - Foot traffic is light, probably due to summer vacation. On a normal weekday at this hour, Haskell says the pedestrian flow would nearly flatten us.\n\n        - \u201cIt\u2019s typically a sea of humanity?\u201d I ask.\n\n        - More like intersecting rivers, he explains. \u201cYou\u2019ve got one coming out of the subway and people flowing north and south. There\u2019s a sinkhole with water bubbling up and being drawn back down.\u201d There\u2019s all this fast \u00adwater, and then the area around the tree is a quiet pool to the side.\n\n        - It\u2019s illegal to obstruct pedestrian traffic\u00a0in New York City, Haskell tells me, so if people need to stop they will duck under the tree. That links the plant to the city\u2019s sociocultural power dynamics. Haskell calls",
