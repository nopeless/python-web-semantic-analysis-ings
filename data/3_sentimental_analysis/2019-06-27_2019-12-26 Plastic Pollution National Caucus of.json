  "readable_content": "-Website (2023-12-08): Issue Area - Plastic Pollution\nOverview\nPlastic pollution is a global crisis with adverse effects on public health and the environment. It is derived from fossil fuels, leading to hazardous air and water conditions during extraction and refining. Hazardous substances within plastics, such as Bisphenol A and PFAS, are associated with health risks. Improper post-consumer management leads to incineration, landfilling, and exportation, exacerbating health and environmental challenges. The pollution has extensive impacts, including ocean contamination, freshwater pollution, and even affecting the food we consume.\n\nTo address this crisis, comprehensive policy strategies are required, including source reduction, improved material recovery, elimination of hazardous substances, and holding producers responsible for end-of-life management. Several legislative initiatives in different states are focused on tackling plastic pollution through various approaches.\n\nResources, news, and events related to combatting plastic pollution, along with NCEL's efforts, are available for further information and engagement with the initiative.\n\nFor more information, contact NCEL\u2019s Zero Waste Coordinator Julia Meltzer.",
