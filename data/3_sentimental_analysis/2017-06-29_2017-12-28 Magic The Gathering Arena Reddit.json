Just think of ALL the different conditions, abilities, enchantments, etc. that go into a game like MTG and imagine having to write those as code and actually make them work as intended. MTG video games are nothing new. In fact, I believe the first game came out around 1997ish While many of their video games were not too similar to the paperback experience, Games like MTGO and Arena are.\n  My point is, I have to give credit where it is due. Game Developers rarely see positive feedback because most feedback is negative as is human nature. Therefore, I would like to extend my thanks to the actual developers of these games. Not the marketers or publishers. The developers.\n  Thank you for your hard work.\n\n- dupue (2023-12-08): How do I get the Baldur's Gate Avatars?
