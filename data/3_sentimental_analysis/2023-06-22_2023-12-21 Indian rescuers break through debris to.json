Good news\n- reuters (2023-12-08): Indian rescuers drilled through rocks and debris on Tuesday to reach 41 workers trapped for 17 days in a collapsed tunnel in the Himalayas, and were set to pull them out one by one to safety, officials said.\n- shabda (2023-12-08): Saying \"broke through debris\" is criminally understating how hard it was.\n- Turbulent-Papaya-910 (2023-12-08): Man this is wild. So glad to hear of the success.\n- PluckPubes (2023-12-08): Wow. I thought they were goners for sure. Great news. Movie rights time.\n- - No-Understanding4968 (2023-12-08): Somehow Akshay Kumar will be in it, mark my words\n- MommyLovesPot8toes (2023-12-08): Such good news!!\n- Actual-Ambassador-37 (2023-12-08): Humans working together to rescue other humans always makes me feel all warm and fuzzy on the inside\n- Punman_5 (2023-12-08): And Elon Musk didn\u2019t call anybody involved in the rescue effort a pedophile. This seems like good news all around.\n- - IMadeUThis (2023-12-08): There were no kids involved, so the story probably didn't interest him enough to project this time.\n- traitorgiraffe (2023-12-08): \"now we expect you to be back at work at 8 am\"\n- ash_4p (2023-12-08): They\u2019re actually being paid Rs. 1 lac (about $1250) each as compensation by the state government.

No output, no pay. /s\n- _RADIANTSUN_ (2023-12-08): Tunnel Snakes rule!\n- AK_Sole (2023-12-08): Great news!\n- ibarmy (2023-12-08): Hopefully this triumph doesn't compensate for any post-mortem on why this thing even happened. The company flouted so many safety rules and the government monitoring bodies were caught sleeping.\n- Beautiful_Fee1655 (2023-12-08): It appears the tunnel support at its entrance was built to withstand the weight above it. It also appears that the miners who got trapped had gone past that section and were digging in a section with insufficient roof support. If the tunnel is not abandoned, future efforts inside must correct this violation.\n- barath_s (2023-12-08): rat-mining Explanation",
