  "body": "The slant is to assist with scooping out, normally, a powdery street narcotic like Cocaine/Meth from a baggy. With the slant (pointed end) you can get into the corners of the baggy and avoid \"waste\". They weren't sealed at one end but that's a great thought! Thanks! Hold baggies/straw up in the light.",
  "readable_content": "- JuliaDD (2015-08-09): Cocaine\n- MissesMayhem (2015-08-09): Adderall, meth, basically anything that can be snorted.\n- xotcflwr (2015-08-09): Are the slanted straws sealed on one end? Like melted the straw and pinched/pressed to seal the opening? The slant is to assist with scooping out, normally, a powdery street narcotic like Cocaine/Meth from a baggy. With the slant (pointed end) you can get into the corners of the baggy and avoid \"waste\".\n\n  - ZhaosFuvall (2015-08-09): That sounds like a lot of straws. Makes me doubt drugs because you don't need that many just to snort the various substances you suspect. Maybe it is really for something else. Ask him.\n\n- OGsweetpotato (2015-08-09): Could be coke, or potentially he was making homemade bongs or pipes and using the straws as stems for the bowl.\n\n- cyanoside (2015-08-09): haven't seen ketamine mentioned here. that can be sniffed",
