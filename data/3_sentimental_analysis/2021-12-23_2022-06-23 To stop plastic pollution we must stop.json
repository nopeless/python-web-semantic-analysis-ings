  "readable_content": "Mongabay.com (2023-12-08): A team of scientists is calling for the cessation of new plastic production to address plastic pollution, citing its impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Negotiations are ongoing for a global treaty to address plastic waste and production. The scientists emphasize the complexities of the plastic problem and the need for multifaceted solutions.\n\n- The scientists argue that a cap on global plastic production is necessary to protect human and environmental health and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. They highlight the agreement to adopt a global plastic treaty and the upcoming negotiation process to finalize its details.\n- The scientists emphasize that current plastic production generates large volumes of greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to the climate crisis, and that plastic waste poses a significant challenge, especially due to exportation from the Global North to the Global South.\n- Research suggests that even with full implementation of possible solutions, about 710 million metric tons of plastic waste will enter terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems over the next 20 years.\n- The scientists stress the urgency of stopping the production of new plastics to prevent further environmental degradation and reduce the carbon footprint of plastics.\n- They point out the broader issue of synthetic pollutants and novel entities, highlighting the need for proper regulation and global agreements to address the production of plastics and other synthetic chemicals.\n\nThis summarizing focuses on the main points of the article. Let me know if you'd like to delve deeper into any specific section!",
