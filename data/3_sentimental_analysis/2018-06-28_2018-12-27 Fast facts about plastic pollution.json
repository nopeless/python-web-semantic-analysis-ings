That\u2019s the equivalent of five grocery bags of plastic trash sitting on every foot of coastline around the world.\n\n40 percent of plastic produced is packaging, used just once and then discarded.\n\nGlobal plastic production by industry:\n- Building and construction: 72 million tons\n- Packaging: 161 million tons\n- Other: 52 million tons\n- Textiles: 65 million tons\n- Consumer products: 46 million tons\n- Industrial machinery: 3 million tons\n- Electrical: 19 million tons\n- Transportation: 30 million tons\n\nChina produces 29% of the world's plastic, while the rest of Asia produces 21%. Half the world\u2019s plastics are made in Asia, with Europe at 19%, NAFTA countries at 18%, Middle East/Africa at 7%, Latin America at 4%, and Other at 2%.\n\nLess than a fifth of all plastic is recycled globally. Plastic recycling rates are highest in Europe at 30 percent, China\u2019s rate is 25 percent, and the United States recycles just 9 percent of its plastic trash.\n\nNearly a million plastic beverage bottles are sold every minute around the world. In 2015, Americans purchased about 346 bottles per person\u2014111 billion plastic beverage bottles in all.\n\nAbout 8 percent of the world\u2019s oil production is used to make plastic and power the manufacturing of it.
