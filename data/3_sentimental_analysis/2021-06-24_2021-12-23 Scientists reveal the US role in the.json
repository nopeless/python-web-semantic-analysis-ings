The report has led to discussions about the need for a national strategy to combat plastic waste.\n\n- The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency have been identified as organizations best positioned to develop a national strategy to curb plastic waste.\n\n- Some critics faulted the recent EPA recycling strategy for not addressing the current level of plastic production, calling for more attention to be given to the creation of plastic in addition to cleaning it up.\n\n- Efforts are being made to address the plastic pollution crisis, with the bipartisan oceans bill enacted last year also calling for a number of other analyses to be completed, including the impacts of microfibers to derelict fishing gear.",
