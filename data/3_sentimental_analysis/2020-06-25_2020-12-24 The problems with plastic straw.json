  "readable_content": "- amandamccoyart (2023-12-08): Thank you!! I\u2019m disabled, but I\u2019m lucky in that most of these issues don\u2019t apply to me as much. I can\u2019t use the wheat based \u201cplastic\u201d due to allergies and can\u2019t drink out of a glass without a straw neatly. (I can do it, but I will spill it every time. I promise you that fancy restaurants get very annoyed when you spill soda down your front and need them to lead you to the bathroom cause on top of that I\u2019m blind and why is every fancy restaurant so dark??) I know many who can\u2019t use stiff straws and many who aren\u2019t coordinated enough to clean reusable straws. Paper straws are hard for me with anxiety since I bite down on my straws a lot without realizing it and end up going through 2-3 straws for 1 drink. I currently use silicone or reusable hard plastic straws at home depending on if I\u2019m in a flare up or not. In public, I tend to get the plastic ones, because that\u2019s what\u2019s on hand. I\u2019ve tried carrying cases for my straws, but they always end up leaking out what\u2019s left of my drink in there or letting dirt in.\n\n- J-McFox (2023-12-08): Is there a mouthpiece that you can buy to clip over the end of paper straws to protect you biting down on it? Seems like something that should exist - if not then I claim copyright and will look into a patent! I guess you'd still have to carry the mouthpiece around - but it might be less messy and cumbersome than a whole straw.",
