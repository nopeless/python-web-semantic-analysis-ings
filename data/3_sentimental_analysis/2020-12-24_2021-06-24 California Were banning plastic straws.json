  "readable_content": "- Interesting-warning (2020-12-08): More like so I can add items into the bag before I hit the door and can steal.\n  - [deleted] (2020-12-08): I stare at them when they ask for a bag for this little cardboard card. Put it in your damn pocket!\n    - eNess215 (2020-12-08): My usual excuse is that they don't want to look like they are stealing. I always tell them they can have 100 of them and nobody will care. They are worthless till scanned. Of course, they still don't understand.\n      - VoodooMoose- (2020-12-08): Damn seen this so many times at 702 in kentucky xD.\n        - Pizzapimento (2020-12-08): Or the plastic boxed single serve donuts and cupcakes.\n          - [deleted] (2020-12-08)\n- nothinfollowsme (2020-12-08): California: \u2018We\u2019re banning plastic straws and plastic bags to help the environment.\u2019 I seem to recall in my state, TX(Dallas fwiu, not sure if it spread anywhere else, but I like to think Austin adopted it too because they pride themselves on being \"progressive\") tried to do that only with charging people a dime for the bags. Then they realized that slapping arbitrary charges on an item is something that only the most galaxy-brained think is a brilliant idea. Then immediately put a stop to it. \ncustomer: \u2018Can I have a plastic bag for my plastic phone card so I don\u2019t lose it?\u2019 I can't stand those customers. Like, the fuck you want a bag for?! No doubt to try to steal. But I've had customers legit ask for a bag for the stupid card and throw it away. I do it, then they take it out of the bag and proceed to scratch it. It's like: \"Why did you even bother asking for a bag?!\"\n  - Gingersnapped87 (2020-12-08): They always tell me it's because \"I don't want to look like I stole it\"",
