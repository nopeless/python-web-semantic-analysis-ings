An estimated 4.8 to 12.7 million metric tonnes of plastic debris entered the world\u2019s oceans from land-based sources in 2010 alone, with this input likely to increase exponentially into the future1. This poses a considerable threat to marine life, primarily through entanglement and ingestion2,3.\n\nSea turtles were among the first taxa recorded to ingest plastic debris7,8, a phenomenon that occurs in every region of the world9 and in all 7 marine turtle species. Globally, it is estimated that approximately 52% of all sea turtles have ingested plastic debris3; however, this varies considerably between regions.\n\nWhile there is clear evidence that ingestion of plastic debris is widespread, and evidence that ingestion has sub-lethal to lethal effects on turtles2,16, to date no quantitative relationship between the amount of plastic ingested by a turtle and the consequences for the individual has been established. \n\n- Therefore, we used these animals as a control group, assuming their mortality was random with respect to the amount of plastic they ingested.\n- We compared these animals to those that died of indeterminate causes, which could include plastic, and to those that were identified as dying due to plastic ingestion based on necropsies.\n\nThe best model, based on Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), for the relationship between the number of debris items in the gut and the cause of death includes a main effect for age class and species. Debris counts were significantly higher in juvenile turtles than in adult turtles.\n\n- (Continued data is not available)",
  "summary": "The post discusses the serious threat that plastic debris, including plastic ingestion, poses to marine life, particularly sea turtles. It emphasizes the need for understanding the quantitative relationship between the amount of plastic ingested and the consequences for individual turtles. The study aims to provide valuable insights into the mortality of sea turtles in relation to plastic ingestion. Overall, the tone is informative and emphasizes the importance of addressing the issue. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
