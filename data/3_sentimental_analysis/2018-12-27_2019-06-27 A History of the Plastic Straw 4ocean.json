  "readable_content": "4ocean Public Benefit Corp. (2023-12-08): A History of the Plastic Straw\n\nThe straw has a long history, with evidence of usage dating back to 3000 B.C. Early examples include straws made of gold and carved wood. Marvin C. Stone patented the paper straw in 1888, and plastic straw designs emerged in the 1960s. However, plastic straws have resulted in environmental issues, leading to bans in various places.\n\nWe at 4ocean recognize the need to address the larger problem of ocean plastic pollution. Our Ocean Plastic Recovery campaign aims to remove millions of pounds of plastic from the ocean. We encourage individuals to share their thoughts on plastic straw bans and consider contributing to our cause.\n\nBy purchasing a 4ocean bracelet, individuals can remove a pound of plastic and trash from the ocean and coastlines, thereby contributing to the initiative to combat ocean plastic pollution.\n\nEnd of blog post",
