  "readable_content": "**IAEA Helps Reduce Plastic Pollution**\n\nI found a text that might interest you. It's about the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) helping to reduce plastic pollution. The original text was sourced from the IAEA website on December 8th, 2023.\n\n- Here's the article:\n\nThe IAEA is working on reducing plastic pollution by promoting the use of biodegradable materials as an alternative to traditional plastics. They are also helping countries manufacture biodegradable plastics using polymers derived from natural sources, such as plants and animals. Through research and training, the IAEA is aiding the development of materials that are both environmentally friendly and commercially viable.\n\nThey are also working on harmonizing methods among countries and training scientists in measuring the molecular weight of natural polymers as well as in the use of radiation processing. The IAEA's efforts extend to various sectors such as agriculture, food industry, and environmental protection. The organization is also involved in raising awareness of environmental issues, including plastic pollution in the oceans, through events and educational initiatives.\n\nThe full article can be accessed on the IAEA's website under the \"News\" section.\n\n- I hope this information is helpful to you!",
