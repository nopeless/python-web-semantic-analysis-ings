  "body": "Paper cups and straws are coated in wax to make them temporarily water proof and permanently unrecyclable aka single use and disposable. Plastic cups and straws can be recycled and reused almost indefinitely, but most people use them as single use products because the plastic is too thin to wash without melting in most dishwashers.",
  "readable_content": "- firebolt1171 (2022-12-08): yes Wendy's, the plastic straw was the problem\n- deleted (2022-12-08): The dumbest part is that the cups used to be paper and the straw was plastic. Now it's the reverse as if that's any better for the environment.\n- kwixtylz1 (2022-12-08): I've actually been reusing a Wendy's plastic cup for a week now. Never done that with any plastic straw. It's a plus in my books.\n- perrinoia (2022-12-08): Paper cups and straws are coated in wax to make them temporarily waterproof and permanently unrecyclable, aka single-use and disposable.\n- thecr0tch (2022-12-08): Why does it say MOM on her neck?\n- moondogg81 (2022-12-08): I noticed that years ago and could never un-see it.\n- firebolt1171 (2022-12-08): Oh god, I can't unsee it.\n- Important-Aside-507 (2022-12-08): took me a second to realize it was a paper straw with a fully plastic cup. I thought it was all plastic and was confused despite the title lol\n- deleted (2022-12-08): I'll take a paper cup with a plastic straw over that any day.\n- Thebadfish843 (2022-12-08): The hypocrisy is extremely infuriating. Nothing mild about it\u2026\n- krysisalcs (2022-12-08): Wendy\u2019s will start using recycled plastic in large cups by early 2022 with a goal of having all its drink cups use the material by 2023. The company is moving from plastic-lined paper cups that have limited recyclability to a single-substrate, clear plastic drink cups that have more recycling potential. The new cups will use 20% certified recycled plastic and will launch in the United States and Canada. Wendy\u2019s says the move is part of a plan to keep 10 million pounds of waste out of landfills over the next two years.\n- Kitchen_Device7682 (2022-12-08): Isn't the problem that plastic straws can get stuck in sea animal noses? I think nobody argues that paper straws will solve the plastic problem. What you should check is if plastic can be recycled.\n- JackMeHoff266 (2022-12-08): I\u2019m not tryna single you out bcuz I\u2019ve seen others post similar things like this, but I don\u2019t understand the sentiment behind this. Yes, I get the stupidity behind using paper straw with plastic cups, but is it not a good thing to reduce plastic usage even in the slightest way? Seems like reducing plastic use in any way is the new trend (in my state, businesses are not allowed to provide plastic bags and straws) and obviously it won\u2019t all happen overnight but at least we can start small and work our way up. Pretty soon, plastic cups will also be banned as well. Also, there\u2019s a reason why plastic straw are specifically targeted - it\u2019s because of their design that causes them to get stuck in sea turtle nostrils and in whales.\n- deleted (2022-12-08): Straws are too skinny and small to get filtered out as recyclables when they filter the recycling so they slip through and end up in landfills. The cups and lids are large enough to get filtered out. So there actually is a reason.\n- Altruistic-Status-98 (2022-12-08): The mom thing was supposed to be subliminal but it's so fricken apparent.",
