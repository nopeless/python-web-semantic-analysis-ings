  "readable_content": "- Team_PANGEA (2023-12-08): The Ocean Pollution Problem That Pangea Ocean Cleanup ($POC) Is Fighting To End\n\nOcean Awareness News\n\nWelcome to the first in a series of informative pieces we will share to help everyone better understand the global ocean pollution problem and the Pangea Ocean Cleanup river barrier solution.\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Plastic pollution is literally killing our oceans, and it is without doubt an environmental issue that deserves global attention and a global solution.\n\nWhy is it happening?\n\nOcean plastic is the result of the exponential growth of plastic production driven by overconsumption, compounded by the lack of efficient waste management. Single-use plastics became popular in the 1950s and while their production was only ~1.8 million tons then, by 2018 the world was producing a staggering 465 million tons.\n\nToday, the plastic pollution problem is undoubtedly most visible in developing Asian and African nations, where there is a combination of dense populations and inefficient or nonexistent garbage collection systems. However, even in the developed world there are low recycling rates in many countries, meaning that most of the plastic we produce ends up damaging the environment in one way or another.\n\nHow much trash pollution is in the ocean?\n\nEight million metric tons: That\u2019s how much plastic we dump into the oceans each year, the equivalent of nearly 57,000 blue whales \u2014 every single year. Worryingly, studies have revealed that by 2050, if nothing is done to curb it, ocean plastic will outweigh all of the oceans' fish. According to National Geographic, there are 5.25 trillion pieces of plastic debris in the ocean. Of those, only 269,000 tons float on the surface, while some 4 billion plastic microfibers per square kilometer cover the deep seas.\n\nThe most common items found in coastal cleanups around the world are all single-use plastics; cigarette butts, food wrappers, beverage bottles, bottle caps, and straws. Among the waste we can\u2019t see are plastic micro-beads (used as exfoliates in some personal care products) and synthetic fibers, both of which are too small to be filtered out by many wastewater treatment plants.\n\nAs shocking as ocean pollution is, what\u2019s below the surface is even worse. More than 70 percent of ocean garbage isn\u2019t on the surface; it sinks to the seafloor, meaning we\u2019re unlikely to ever be able to clean it up. Overtime ocean trash breaks into tiny pieces known as microplastics, a process that is accelerated by exposure to the sun, waves, and salt water - after which the microplastics can find their way into the food chain. Once plastic eventually degrades, which takes 400 years for most plastic, it releases chemicals that further contaminate the sea.\n\nWe only started producing plastic within the last 100 years, so most of the plastic in the ocean has not fully degraded.\n\n- Team_PANGEA (2023-12-08): Yet, by 2004, scientists found 146 hypoxic zones - these are areas in the oceans with such a low oxygen concentration that ocean animal life suffocates and dies. These dead zones are rapidly increasing in number; by 2008 there had been 405 discovered, and that\u2019s only the ones we know about so far. So how big are these zones? The largest dead zone oceanographers detected is in the Gulf of Mexico and it\u2019s nearly the size of New Jersey.\n\nSo how does Plastic Pollution actually impact the environment?\n- Depletes oxygen in ocean water\n- Introduces toxic waste to marine animals\n- Kills & disrupts the life cycle of coral reefs\n- The majority of fish we consume as humans (trout, perch, cisco, etc) would have ingested plastic and microfibers\n- Causes failure in the reproductive system of marine animals\n- Contaminates the food chain as ocean wildlife often mistakes trash as food. These animals starve to death, clogging their stomachs with plastic so they can\u2019t eat real food\n\nLooking at the statistics further, it becomes even more worrying. One hundred million marine animals die each year from exposure to plastic waste alone. One hundred thousand marine animals die from getting entangled in plastic yearly. Marine plastic pollution was found in 100% of turtles, 59% of whales, and 36% of seals in recent studies. More than 90% of all seabirds were found to have plastic pieces in their stomachs. Mammals like seals drown in the 705,000 tons of discarded fishing nets\n\n- Team_PANGEA (2023-12-08): So where does the trash come from?.\nThe Ocean Cleanup estimated that just over 1000 rivers account for 80% of global annual emissions, which range between 0.8 million and 2.7 million metric tons per year, with small urban rivers among the most polluting.\n\nStay tuned for the next piece, which will dive into the solutions to the ocean pollution problem, including ours, with a focus on low-cost and locally built solutions such as river barriers, which tackle the problem at the source, quickly, and at scale.\n\nIt's clear the more trash that enters the ocean, the greater the long term impacts will be.\n\nLearn more about Pangea Ocean Cleanup ($POC):\n\nWebsite: www.pangeaoceancleanup.com\n- Telegram: https://t.me/PANGEAOceanClean\n- Discord: https://discord.gg/UjVSnZxChx\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/PangeaOceanCoin\n- YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSjMDWjeSTBIjgf3gWGVWtg\n- Buy On Pancake Swap: http://bit.ly/POC-PancakeSwap",
