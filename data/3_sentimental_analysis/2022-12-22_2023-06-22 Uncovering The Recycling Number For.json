While most plastic products are labeled with recycling numbers, it is not always clear what number plastic straws should be assigned. This article will explore what the recycling number for plastic straws is, why it is important to recycle plastic straws, and how to effectively recycle them. Understanding the recycling number of plastic straws is essential to reducing plastic waste and protecting the environment.\n\nEach person in the United States consumes an average of 16 straws per day, which accounts for 500 million straws per day.

Millions of these straws are discarded each day, putting an undue strain on the environment. They can also become ill if not treated properly.
