  "body": "It was actually quite the fight since all the clubs are %99 rich elderly people who did NOT want to part with their precious plastic straws haha. Even the club I work at has gone back and forth between biodegradable and plastic due to the members throwing a fit. We just got back on the biodegradable train, thank goodness.",

I've already gotten a few restaurants in San Diego to opt out for biodegradable straws, the change is happening \ud83d\udc9a\n\n- lazyjz (2017-12-08): What restaurants in SD?\n\n- vampyrotoothus (2017-12-08): Signed! I've wanted this for a while now.\n\n- OctaviusPublius (2017-12-08): Is there a reason you are petitioning the federal EPA instead of the Californian government?\n\n- napoleander (2017-12-08): While, I agree plastic shouldn\u2019t be used at all, I do have a question. What would the impact of everyone using biodegradable be? They still have to be manufactured and the ones I\u2019ve seen use a corn base and are compostable. But I\u2019m not sure how much corn it takes to make the straws. Maybe y\u2019all are using something completely different too. So basically I guess my question is what\u2019s the side effect of millions of people using biodegradable straws during the manufacturing process?\n\n- tayyylooor (2017-12-08): Yeah San Diego!",
