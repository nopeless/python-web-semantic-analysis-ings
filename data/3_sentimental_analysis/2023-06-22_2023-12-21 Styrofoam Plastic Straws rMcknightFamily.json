  "readable_content": "Few_Enthusiasm6474 (2023-10-08): Styrofoam & Plastic Straws\nSip Shitty\ud83e\udd64\n\nStarting a business in 2023 and launching with non recyclable packaging - styrofoam and plastic straws really makes me sad\u2026 I\u2019m from New Zealand and you\u2019re hard pressed here to be able to find plastic straws in takeaway or restaurant form, most places it\u2019s paper or no straw and the takeaway cups are either plastic and recyclable or they\u2019re paper/recycled products\u2026\n\nJust like LND it\u2019s just more crap going into the environment - definitely no sustainable queens over here\n\n- Strict-Ad-6263: Bailey cracks me up cause she try to make every little thing a quirky personality trait. Now it\u2019s biting a straw next it\u2019ll be \u201comg I breathe through my nose. So crazy haha\u201d\n- oneghoulishgal: Everything is \u201comg am I the only one who does ___?!\u201d No girl you aren\u2019t \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\n- Careless_Ad3968: They're the poster women for excessive consumption, I wouldn't expect anything less from them. Man, on the subject of Sip City, Brooklyn and Brokota just went the Lash Next Door route. Slapped their brand on Shein stuff (Swig) and went from there.\n- xoxodreamgirl: She\u2019s so quirky for biting her straw!\n- Excellent-Suit-7082: Sip City has branded Stanley cups that the whole family bought which were probs pretty expensive. These girls are getting drinks almost every day there and they can\u2019t use the reusable cups even some of the time?\u2026 They just don\u2019t care.\n- Lovemydoggos21: Ok but it looks like the straw is going up her nose\n- oogleyshaboogley: It\u2019s getting so cringe to watch Bailey constantly grasping at straws for \u201crelatable\u201d content\u2026. No pun intended\n- mooregatehoe: Pretty sure in canada both the styrofoam cup and straw are banned\n- cbags88: As an Aussie is crazy seeing plastic and styrofoam things being used in take away, 90% if places probably more are paper and cardboard. Plastic straws are even banned\n- internsearcher25: Also from NZ and it's so sad how wasteful everything they do is. NZ isn't by any means a pinnacle of sustainability and ive seen very wasteful influencers and people here but they're another level. They even drink from plastic bottles\n- EggLikeHuman: Wow, why would they choose to use styrofoam? Styrofoam has been banned in my country for years, we barely see any now.\n- [deleted]: that\u2019s crazy! shes like legit the only person that bites on straws! \ud83d\ude3b\ud83d\ude3b\n- happysewing: This... is content?\n- cohen63: Not to Stan here but this debate about plastic straws for paper straws is totally not worth it. Snark if you want but I honestly hate paper straws because 90% of the time I need 2 or 3 to finish my drink because it gets too soggy\n- [deleted]: Yesss i can\u2019t even snark on them for that bc I will choose plastic straws over paper ones any day and I know I should be better. I just hate the way the drinks taste out of a paper one\u2026 but Starbucks uses compostable plastic straws so maybe the sip city uses them too? I can\u2019t tell the difference lol\n- Armymom96: So get reusable straws. We haven't used straws from a restaurant in about 5 years. They take 2 seconds to wash. C'mon people. It's not that hard to do little things for the planet that add up. This sub especially seems full of people who don't give a rat's ass. Downvote me all you want.\n- porkrindloaf: They probably were the cheapest option so they ordered a ton... a bad choice on their part\n- amandamarie0701: I rather have a plastic straw then a crappy paper one any day",
