  "readable_content": "Spiderranger (2015-10-06): Hey guys. My girlfriend was recently told she may have a gluten allergy so she's going gluten-free for a month. Sour Straws are like her favorite candy and she's really upset that she can't have any. Anybody know of another brand of sour straws or something similar that is gluten free? Or better yet, any recipes to make your own sour straws? I've found stuff for sour gummy worms and other sour gummies, but they're \"not the same\" (which I agree with).\n\nahnkou (2015-10-06): I've been looking for same thing or sour belts... I thought I found belts on amazon but we're crazy expensive, I'll post if I can find it again.\n\n- crankypants15 (2015-10-06): What about sour gummy bears? I eat all kinds of gummy candy with no problem.\n\n- isweedglutenfree (2015-10-06): I die a little inside every time I see sour punch straws\n\nSad-Shape-312 (2022-12-07): https://www.markethallfoods.com/products/sour-fruit-strips-from-ashby-confections I just found these!",
