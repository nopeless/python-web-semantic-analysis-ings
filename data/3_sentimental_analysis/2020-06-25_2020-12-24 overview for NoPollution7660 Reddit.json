  "readable_content": "No_Pollution_7660 (2023-12-08): I would love to go for the xm5, but the design language is not for me lol. Imo looks too bulky and protruding, I love how the xm4 looks and also bigger drivers compared to xm5's 30 mm drivers.\n\n- astrokinng (2023-10-08): Are you considering the xm5 as well, or strictly sticking to xm4?\n\n- Super_Junket_5416 (2023-10-08): Should I buy or wait for the price to drop further?\n\n- No_Pollution_7660 (2023-10-08): Budget and aesthetics lol. Not really a fan of how the xm5 looks, it's bulky, can't be folded and the head band is narrower than xm4.\n\n- prakhart66ashu (2023-10-08): Apple only supports AAC , not ldac nor aptx. Expect to get a downgrade in bitrate but afaik it doesn't make alot of difference.\n\n- No_Pollution_7660 (2023-10-08): I would love to go for the xm5, but the design language is not for me lol. Imo looks too bulky and protruding, I love how the xm4 looks and also bigger drivers compared to xm5's 30 mm drivers.\n\n- Just_Low_1294 (2023-09-08): XM4 or XM5 question again.\n\n- No_Pollution_7660 (2023-09-08): It\u2019s his money lol",
