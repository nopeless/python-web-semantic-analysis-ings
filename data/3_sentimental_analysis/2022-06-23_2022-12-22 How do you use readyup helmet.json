In fact it' more of a gimmick, the lore states that people wear these in Lorville to combat the huge amount of air pollution there. It's like the 2952 version of a covid mask.",
  "readable_content": "Lord-Rufus (2022-12-08): The Ready-Up is a hat manufactured by Gyson Inc.. It is a popular budget softshell helmet made primarily of industrial-strength plastic. It barely met United Empire of Earth standards and received the lowest rating possible from Whitley\u2019s Guide.
