  "readable_content": "-User12345 (2023-12-08): I just read a BBC article about the significant contribution of microplastics from car tyres and synthetic fabrics to marine pollution. It's alarming to learn that up to 30% of plastic released into the oceans every year comes from primary microplastics, rather than the disintegration of larger plastic waste. The report also highlights that synthetic textiles are the main source of primary microplastics in Asia, while tyres dominate in the Americas, Europe, and Central Asia. This information really sheds light on the extensive impact of everyday activities on marine pollution and emphasizes the need for concerted efforts to address this problem.",
