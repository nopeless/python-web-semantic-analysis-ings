We all know the whole controversy about replacing plastic straws with paper straws and that paper straws are really annoying and ineffective and just kinda lame but allow me to introduce a new player here. Cinnamon sticks. They're long and hallow and you can easily drink through them, they don't dissolve in water like paper, they're a million times fancier than any plastic, paper, metal straws and whatnot, they're naturally biodegradable and cinnamon pairs well with basically any beverage on earth. Ever had a drink with a cinnamon stick in it and could barely feel the cinnamon and got kinda disappointed? Solves that too. Just had cider and wine with a cinnamon stick, used it as a straw and it was marvelous. I get that this might be a little expensive, but we'll find a way. Maybe just de-fund the police or something for this, idk.\n\nIn short, cinnamon sticks in, any other kind of useless straws out. Who's with me?\n\n- smiff8866 (2021-12-08): That\u2019s quite smart. Or you could use Twizzlers.\n- Vv2333 (2021-12-08): Bamboo\n- temporary_username (2021-12-08): Less of a tasty kick. Could call it \"virgin cinnamon straws\" for people who don't like cinnamon.\n- [deleted] (2021-12-08): Genius level thinking sir. Imagine going to Starbucks and getting one of these with a seasonal drink?! Or a candy cane fruit flavored for the summer. Fuck yes I\u2019m down. You just solved one of the world\u2019s simplest but ongoing problems ahaha.\n  - Chilli-key (2021-12-08): I wish all companies good luck on paying 1$ per cinnamon straw. And then serving it for a 3$ drink.\n- SeanFromQueens (2021-12-08): Or use the same wax paper that the cup is made of. Not sure why the disintegrating once exposed to liquid is being used for straws but the also non-plastic cup is not what he material being used. Straws predate disposable plastic, so use whatever they used in the first place. Problem solved.\n  - [deleted] (2021-12-08): De-fund the police so that the government can start subsidizing buying massive amount of cinnamon sticks to use as straws. This is some top tier half-baked drunk problem solving.\n  - temporary_username (2021-12-08): Modern problems require modern solutions.\n  - Doodabs_gaz (2021-12-08): Hemp plastic\n  - temporary_username (2021-12-08): Not nearly as fancy as cinnamon sticks.\n  - keIIzzz (2021-12-08): i mean this works if you like cinnamon I guess, but not all of us do and there are people who are allergic as well\n    - temporary_username (2021-12-08): Yeah, obviously this isn't a great option for people who are allergic but I think it's a very cool alternative for places to offer.\n  - xBram (2021-12-08): I\u2019m a little drunk too, I\u2019m thinking of an app so you can use your phone as a straw.\n    - temporary_username (2021-12-08): How about an app that temporarily turns your phone into a cinnamon stick that can be used as a straw?",
