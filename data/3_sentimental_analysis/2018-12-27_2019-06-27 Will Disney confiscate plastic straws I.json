  "readable_content": "- Bacon_Guy_derp (2018-12-08): Will Disney confiscate plastic straws I bring in? Going next Sunday, just wanted to know before I did attempt to bring some into the parks.\n- [deleted] (2018-12-08): Animal kingdom, yes. Others I am unsure. Why not invest in some silicone straws from Amazon? Reusable and good for the environment in the long run. Plus they\u2019re flexible.\n- slimredcobb (2018-12-08): I bring plastic straws into MK, HS, and Epcot on the reg. Usually they laugh about it. Haven\u2019t been to AK since the ban started.\n- Lizzimae (2018-12-08): For Animal Kingdom, probably yes. For the safety of the animals.\n- jbguitar2196 (2018-12-08): I could see it in Animal Kingdom at least, as they use paper in lieu plastic utensils there.\n- tikibirdie (2018-12-08): No. You just won\u2019t be able to get one from Disney.\n- [deleted] (2018-12-08)\n- mamamiadadamax (2018-12-08): No, probably not.
