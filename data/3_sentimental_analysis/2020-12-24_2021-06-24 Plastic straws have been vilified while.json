I\u2019ve definitely seen the trash truck pickup both bins and dump them into the same truck on numerous occasions and then wonder why my wife spends extra money on the special \u201crecycling bags\u201d required by our city.\n\n- BafangFan (2020-12-08): Hey, free trash capacity is free trash capacity! Saves people from having to pay more for a bigger trash can.\n\n- cwm33 (2020-12-08): I have a nice assortment of metal straws, those paper ones are just awful.\n\n- Smakes25 (2020-12-08): It also distracts from the fact that most waste in the ocean is fishing nets. It's always easier to make consumers feel bad than hold corporations accountable.\n-- android24601 (2020-12-08): Netflix: Seaspiracy\n\n- AJ_Rimmer_SSC (2020-12-08): If they would out wax on em I wouldn't mind paper straws as much.\n\n- mojojojo31 (2020-12-08): I swear online sellers wrap everything four times!\n\n- Goodpie2 (2020-12-08): That's what we call a \"scapegoat\"\n-- that_guy898 (2020-12-08): Paper straws are the \u201cthoughts and prayers\u201d of conservationism\n\n- [deleted] (2020-12-08)\n\n- Applejuiceinthehall (2020-12-08): This is a false dichotomy. Even if there are other things to do that doesn't mean we shouldn't get rid of straws if we have the chance.\n-- mwoods60 (2020-12-08): I have some glass straws, kinda awesome. With a little carry case so you can take with you places and they came with a little cleaner brush.\n\n- People think they\u2019re funny, but I see them look jealous when I have a classy straw.\n-- nimrodh2o (2020-12-08): Glassy\n-- decrementsf (2020-12-08): Eliminating PFC's from grocery shopping is too difficult. Foods wrapped in plastic everywhere. Optimizing grocery for reusable storage needs to be a thing. Would be happy to bring glass bottles to refill milk, non-plastic containers for most bagged produce. Make wax paper for butchered goods cool again.\n-- hummus12345 (2020-12-08): To save the environment I just use my own straws made from hollowed and dried panda peni.\n\n- Faktafabriken (2020-12-08): Got a paper straw in a plastic package last weekend when buying a juicebox. Single package.",
