In this context, \"X cannot be overstated\" means that it's impossible to overstate the importance of X (rather than meaning that one isn't allowed to overstate the importance of X).

  "readable_content": "- IamVAcer (2019-12-08): The importance cannot be understated/overstated\nI am pretty confused with this phrase:\n\nAccording to the internet, if something is really important, the importance cannot be overstated. But why is that so? If something can't be overstated, doesn't that means that it should not be overstated and it should not be important?\n\nI am quite confused and the online search doesn't help. Any idea why is it so?\n\n- openapple (2019-12-08):\nIn this context, \u201cX cannot be overstated\u201d means that it\u2019s impossible to overstate the importance of X (rather than meaning that one isn\u2019t allowed to overstate the importance of X).\n\nSo when someone says \u201cthe importance of X cannot be overstated,\u201d they\u2019re saying that no matter how large you describe the importance of X, your description still won\u2019t be an overstatement of that importance (because its importance is greater than what one is able to describe).\n\n- monktastic1 (2019-12-08):\nAlso note the relationships between \"cannot\" and \"should not\" (here using over/underestimated):\n\nIt cannot be overestimated = No matter how hard you try, you won't overestimate it.\n\nIt should not be underestimated = You shouldn't underestimate it, because if you do, you'll be in trouble.\n\n- Tarquin_McBeard (2019-12-08):\nIf something can't be overstated, doesn't that means that it should not be overstated\nThis doesn't logically follow at all. If something can't be done, it can't be done. If something shouldn't be done, it shouldn't be done. Can't and shouldn't mean totally different things. That's why they're different words.\n\nConsider these similar examples:\n\nA: \"I'm worried about kicking the ball too high.\"\nB: \"You can't kick the ball too high. The fence is tall enough to block it.\"\n\nA: \"I'm worried about kicking the ball too high.\"\nB: \"You shouldn't kick the ball too high. If you do, it'll go over the fence and break the neighbour's window.\"\n\nIf something can't be done, that means it's impossible. If something shouldn't be done, then it must at least be possible. They are, for the purposes of this discussion at least, practically opposites.\n\nSo you can see that if the importance of something can't be overstated, it must be a very important thing indeed. But if the importance of something shouldn't be overstated, it probably isn't that important.\n\n- Yelloow_eoJ (2019-12-08):\nBut if the importance of something shouldn't be underestimated, it is important.\n\n- reddittroll569 (2019-12-08):\nI laughed nonstop at this comment and I don't know why.",
