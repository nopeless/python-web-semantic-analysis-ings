Made of plastic, most straws have the advantage of being tough yet light and hygienic in the past. However, they were hard to recover and required hundreds of years to decompose due to these characteristics. They not only caused environmental issues after entering the environment or accumulating in landfills, but also broke down into microplastics during the decomposition process. This caused even greater damage to ecosystems. According to statistics, around 63 to 142 billion straws were used in the US in 2017. Meanwhile, 36.4 billion straws were used in the EU countries. These are extremely enormous numbers. Degradable in the environment, biodegradable straws have become a new consumer trend around the globe in the hope of solving the issue of single-use straws. This article will introduce biodegradable straws with an explanation of what they are, their characteristics as well as advantages and disadvantages.\n\nWhat is Biodegradable Straw?\n\nAfter use, biodegradable straws can be decomposed by microorganisms, bacteria and algae that naturally live in the environment. Most of these straws consist of biobased materials including bagasse, rice hulls, wheat or corn while some others are made of fossil-based materials. However, the decomposition conditions and times vary due to different manufacturing methods and materials. In order to regulate biodegradable straws, economies such as the US and the EU have established standards including the ASTM D6400 and the EN 13432. As a result, \u201ccompostable plastics\u201d that can be decomposed in a certain time under specific conditions have been further divided from the field of biodegradable materials.\n\nBiodegradable Straws are Eco-friendly Alternative to Single-Use Plastics\n\nIn 2015, the sea turtle conservation group the Leatherback Trust released an appalling video of pulling a plastic straw out of the nose of a sea turtle. Shocked, people realized the harm that single-use plastic straws can bring to the environment. Considering the demand for safety, hygiene and convenience when drinking beverages, biodegradable straws would be the hope to replace single-use plastic straws and reduce the damage to the environment after using straws while maintaining the help of single-use plastic straws to the daily life.\n\n6 Benefits of Biodegradable Straws\nNo microplastics issue\n\nAfter plastic enters the environment, it will gradually become brittle, degrade and break down in the sunlight. These broken plastics will turn into microplastics and reach every corner in the world through the water cycle, including rivers, lakes, and the oceans. Accumulated in the body of animals in these environments, the microplastics will eventually be swallowed by people along with fish, shrimp, and shellfish. Hazardous substances (e.g. heavy metals) can easily adhere to these microplastics, and this gives them the chance to enter and damage the body. By contrast, biodegradable straws can be naturally decomposed in the environment instead of becoming microplastics and getting in the body.\n\nReduction of the volume of marine waste\n\nIn accordance with the statistics made by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), at least 14 million tons of plastic enter the ocean each year, accounting 80% of all marine waste. Most of these plastics are unproperly disposed waste from the land that entered the ocean through rivers or groundwater. They can harm marine animals by swallowing, suffocation and entanglement. Hence, the use of biodegradable straws can reduce the volume of marine waste as well as the negative impact on marine ecosystems caused by people.\n\nSafe and non-toxic\n\nBiodegradable straws are mostly made of plant-based materials, so they hardly generate toxic substances. On the contrary, plastic straws may contain chemical additives such as heat stabilizers, ultraviolet stabilizers, colorants and plasticizers during the manufacturing process, and these could be released due to abrasion, temperature changes or erosion of acid drinks when using the straws. At present, it is uncertain if these substances will harm the body over time, so biodegradable straws would be a safer choice.\n\nReduction of greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions\n\nThe source of plastic is petrochemical raw materials. First of all, crude oil needs to be transported from oil-producing countries to other countries across the ocean. After it is thermally fractionated and cracked in local processing plants, the plastic materials generated will be delivered to plastics manufacturing factories and then made into all kinds of plastic. This transportation and manufacturing process will produce large amounts of greenhouse gases (GHG). The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) pointed out that in 2019, 18 billion tons of GHG were generated from plastics, which was 3.4% of the total GHG emitted globally. It is expected that 43 billion tons \u2013 more than twice the number at present \u2013 of GHG will be produced from plastics in 2060. This will further cause climate change. By using biodegradable straws, the demand for plastic can be reduced and further resulting in the decrease of GHG emissions.\n\nReduction of volume of waste\n\nThe issue of waste is facing every country around the world. Most waste enters landfills or incinerators and then causes soil, water, and air pollution during the handling process of decomposition or burning. Therefore, both facilities are NIMBY (not-in-my-backyard) for local residents. According to the OECD\u2019s statistics, the recovery rate of global plastic waste only reaches 9%. Furthermore, small single-use plastic straws are almost impossible to recycle for reuse. As a result, biodegradable straws can help reduce the amount of waste and further mitigate the global waste problem.\n\nSafety and hygiene\n\nBesides biodegradable straws, one can also use reusable straws that can be recycled and made into other products, or cut the use of straws and drink from the cup directly. However, as reusable straws are made of stainless steel or glass, there might be safety concerns while carrying or using them, and they need to be cleaned properly to ensure good hygiene. Additionally, in special situations where drinking from a cup is not ideal, such as driving, exercising, or in hospitals, the use of biodegradable straws can ensure safety and convenience.\n\nPros and Cons of Biodegradable Straws\n\nWith the advantage of being safe, hygienic, eco-friendly and convenient, biodegradable straws are one of the best substitutes for single-use plastic straws. Although, they do have some disadvantages. For example, biodegradable straws made of some materials including paper and pasta, will provide unnatural and negative taste such as paper-like, metallic, and wheat-like taste, affecting the experience of drinking beverages.",
  "summary": "The post discusses the benefits of using biodegradable straws as an eco-friendly alternative to single-use plastics, highlighting various advantages including reduction of marine waste, safety and non-toxicity, reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and reduction of overall waste. It also acknowledges some potential disadvantages of biodegradable straws, such as providing unnatural taste. Overall, the post presents a positive sentiment towards the idea of using biodegradable straws as a better solution for the environment. Sentiment: 0.8",
