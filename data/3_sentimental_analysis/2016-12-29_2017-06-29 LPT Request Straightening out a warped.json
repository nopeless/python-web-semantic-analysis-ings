What's the best way to straighten it back out again without melting it? Thanks!\n\ndragonpeace (2016-01-20): Boil a pot of water on the stove. Get a pair of tongs with silicone handles and pick up the straw with the tongs. Hold the straw submerged in the water but not touching the bottom of the pot. Wait for it to relax back out again. If it doesn't seem to straighten, remove it from the water and while it is still warm gently push a wooden chopstick inside and let it cool. Or leave the chopstick inside and boil it again for a minute or so.\n\n- [deleted] (2016-01-20): You can get a dozen new straws for like, $2. Throw that shit away.",
