  "readable_content": "- Reading Mode (2023-12-08): The impacts of plastic pollution continue to be a growing concern, with the problem expected to worsen by 2040 according to a report co-produced in 2020 by The Pew Charitable Trusts and SYSTEMIQ. As a response, a modelling tool called the Breaking the Plastic Wave Pathways Tool (\"Pathways\") has been created to help governments and stakeholders in finding solutions to combat plastic pollution. The tool aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how plastic moves through the economic system and potentially ends up in the environment.\n\n- Richard Bailey, a professor of environmental systems at the University of Oxford, explains that the tool serves as a way to quantify the flow of plastic from its production to its disposal, giving users the ability to alter different components of the system to see how it affects the overall outcome. Bailey emphasizes the importance of customized solutions based on local contexts, suggesting that the tool can provide scenarios and test different policies to help achieve specific goals related to plastic waste management.\n\n- The Pathways tool has been designed to be user-friendly and adaptable to different countries by allowing them to populate the model with their own data and policies. Bailey expresses his hope that the tool will be utilized effectively to address the complexities of plastic pollution and contribute to finding practical solutions.\n\n- Looking forward, Bailey envisions the continued improvement and accessibility of the tool to better aid in addressing the challenges posed by plastic pollution. He expresses confidence in the potential of the Pathways tool to provide users with helpful pathways forward in combatting plastic pollution.",
