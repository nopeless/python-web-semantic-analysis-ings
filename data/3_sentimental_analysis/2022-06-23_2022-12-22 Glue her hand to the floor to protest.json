Open a bunch of cans of surstromming just out of arms reach of the protestors. Setup fans to blow the smell in their direction. Profit.\n  - ThermionicEmissions (2022-11-29): That may be classified as chemical warfare under the Geneva Convention\n  - Dumb_Vampire_Girl (2022-11-29): OH NO THE PROTESTORS ARE OLD SWEDISH PEOPLE\nTHE SURSTOMMING ISNT WORKING\n  - [More replies]\n  - micktalian (2022-11-29): I swear, these people have to be getting paid by some oil company to do this *** and make every other environmentalist look crazy by association.\n  - Scoobie101 (2022-11-29): Lowkey was thinking the same thing. Yeah all these people are crazy, and they\u2019re actively making protesting look sooo bad. Definitely feels like some scheme so when meaningful protests happen they can be downplayed as \u201ccrazy people\u201d by media.\n  - Sad_Visual_8727 (2022-11-29): Those ppl in a nutshell....\n  - [More replies]\n  - Thorn669 (2022-11-29): Serious question, do people really call outdoor surfaces \"the floor\"? Like, to me \"the floor\" is interior surfaces, while exterior surfaces are \"the ground\". Cultural, or am I just misguided, lol?\n  - Aron0415 (2022-11-29): I agree with you - that's what I was taught.\n  - [More replies]\n  - [deleted] (2022-11-29): Hahahaha did you just glue yourself to ***?\nProtester: \"you're never gonna remove me!\"\nLiterally anyone: No we're gonna remove you sooo hard, but it's also gonna hurt like *** and make us laugh for hours\n- TheHighBuddha (2022-11-29): gwlu\n  - Peterwithnobones (2022-11-29): Why aren't we just leaving these people where they glue themselves and let them figure it out? And arrest anyone who tries to free them for violating their right to protest. Simple. Problem will clear itself up.\n  - [More replies]\n  - weirdoldhobo1978 (2022-11-29): Is this from the same climate protest group that's funded by an oil heiress?\n- arcadia_2005 (2022-11-29): Justice here would be charging this person with what they're protesting. And then sentencing being community service cleaning litter.\n- View more comments",
