  "readable_content": "- Smithsonian Magazine (2023-12-08): The Washington Post reports on a study that shows 90 percent of seabirds have ingested some form of plastic. Researchers have found that between 1962 and 2012, 29 percent of individual seabirds\u2019 guts had plastic fragments and 60 percent of the species studied had ingested plastic fragments. The study estimates a current ingestion rate of 90 percent of individual seabirds, with this number projected to increase to 99 percent by 2050 due to growing plastic production. The Tasman Sea, previously considered \u201crelatively pristine,\u201d has been identified as a hotspot for plastic ingestion. The researchers emphasize that individual actions, such as recycling and reducing plastic use, along with waste management measures, can help mitigate this issue.",
  "summary": "The post highlights the alarming impact of plastic pollution on seabirds, with a projected increase in plastic ingestion rates. It emphasizes the importance of individual actions and waste management measures to address this issue. The overall sentiment is one of concern and a call to action towards reducing plastic use and implementing better waste management practices.\n\nSentiment: 0.8",
