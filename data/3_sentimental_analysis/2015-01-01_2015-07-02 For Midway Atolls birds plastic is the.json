The human population of the 2.4 square mile island, on the other hand, is only about 40. Residents are either studying the albatross and other native oceanic wildlife, supporting that research via management and maintenance work or keeping Henderson Field, a one-runway airport used for emergency landings, running. At this point, Midway truly belongs to the birds.\n\nThere\u2019s only one challenger to the albatrosses\u2019 claim to Midway: plastic. This tiny speck of land \u2014 about 3,200 miles from San Francisco and 1,200 miles northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands \u2014 is blanketed not just by birds, but also by garbage.\n\nPlastic is so ubiquitous on Midway that every single albatross on the island will likely die with a stomach full of it. A typical albatross stomach includes \u201cstuff about the size of a cigarette lighter \u2013 everything from golf balls to shotgun shells, or chunks of plastic that used to be something bigger,\u201d according to Bret Wolfe, deputy manager of the\u00a0Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge. When birds die and decompose, the plastic in their guts remains.\n\nMuch of the plastic waste is brought back by the albatrosses. Their favorite food, squid, can easily be mistaken for plastic. The birds, renowned for their long distance flying abilities, snap up the squid-like plastic from waters near Alaska and carry it a thousand miles or more back to Midway. There, the birds either regurgitate it for their young or else ultimately die of natural causes with the garbage still in their stomachs.\n\nGetting plastic to Midway is easy, at least for albatrosses. Getting rid of it, though, is nearly impossible. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) helps whenever its ships are in the area by carting away as much debris as it can, but every trip is a risk because invasive species could be hitching a ride on the ship\u2019s hull. For that reason, private ships aren\u2019t allowed to dock at Midway even during emergencies, according to Wolfe.\n\nThat\u2019s a key reason why it would be so costly \u2014 too costly, according to federal officials \u2014 to undertake a major cleanup of the atoll. Instead, the people of Midway are stuck performing a kind of permanent triage focusing on corralling the largest, most threatening debris.\n\n-User (2023-12-08): Clip 1 of 2",
