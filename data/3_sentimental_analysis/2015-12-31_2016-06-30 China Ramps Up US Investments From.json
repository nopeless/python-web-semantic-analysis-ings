The company has set up operations in Allentown, Pennsylvania, to produce and supply its products in the U.S. This move is seen as a strategic business decision to save on shipping time and costs, and to cater to the preference for products made in the U.S. Fuling Plastic's investment and establishment in the area are also expected to attract other Chinese companies to follow suit. This trend of Chinese investments in the U.S. spans various industries, such as entertainment, automotive parts, and semiconductors, and is projected to reach a record $30 billion in the current year. The growth in Chinese investment is attributed to economic changes by Beijing, allowing more private companies to engage in overseas acquisitions, ultimately leading to the company's expansion and employment opportunities in the U.S.",
