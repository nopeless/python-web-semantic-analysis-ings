However, despite research efforts investigating plastics in oceans, relatively little studies have focused on freshwater systems. The aim of this study was to estimate the spatial distribution, types, and characteristics of macro-, meso-, and microplastic fragments in shoreline sediments of a freshwater lake.\n-visitor (2023-12-08): Food wrappers (mainly polypropylene and polystyrene), bags (high- and low-density polyethylene), bottles (polyethylene terephthalate), and disposable Styrofoam food containers (expanded polystyrene) were the dominant macroplastics recorded in this study. Contrary to other studies, herein macroplastic item surveys would not serve as surrogates for microplastic items.\n-visitor (2023-12-08): Otherwise, an average of 25 mesoplastics (mainly expanded polystyrene) and 704 microplastic particles (diverse resins) were recorded per square meter in sandy sediments. Comparisons with other studies from freshwater and marine beaches indicated similar relevance of plastic contamination, demonstrating for the first time that plastic pollution is a serious problem in the Paran\u00e1 floodplain lakes. This study is also valuable from a social/educational point of view, since plastic waste has been ignored in the Paran\u00e1 catchment as a pollutant problem, and therefore, the outcome of the current study is a relevant contribution for decision makers.\n-visitor (2023-12-08): Keywords: Endanger environment; FT-IR spectrophotometer; Floodplain lake; Macro-, meso-, and microplastic; Plastic pollution.\n-visitor (2023-12-08): PubMed Disclaimer\n-visitor (2023-12-08): ...\n-visitor (2023-12-08): MeSH PMC Bookshelf Disclaimer\n-visitor (2023-12-08): The PubMed wordmark and PubMed logo are registered trademarks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).
