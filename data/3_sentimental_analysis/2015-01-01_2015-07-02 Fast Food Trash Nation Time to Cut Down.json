Time to Cut Down on Packaging Waste.\nFebruary 6, 2015\nPeter Lehner\nFormer Executive Director\n\nEvery spring, my wife and I pick up garbage along the road near the house where she grew up. We aim to do this after the snow melts and before the poison ivy comes out. It's not clean or fun work, but we like doing something -- not just planning to do something -- to help our community.\n\nThe garbage varies: a pair of sneakers on the roadside; a matching couch and loveseat on the iced-over reservoir; Heineken tall boys and cans of Bud. There is always a lot; usually the garbage from a three-mile stretch of road fills a pick-up. But one thing is consistent: fast food trash. Cups and bottles, bags, wrappers, and boxes, spread over yards of countryside. Much of this is recyclable. Some is destined for landfills. Stuff that doesn't get collected might end up in a giant garbage patch in the ocean. As I pick up the mess, I often wonder if these restaurants could do more to urge customers not to litter. It turns out, according to a new NRDC report, they could be doing a whole lot more than that to cut down on packaging waste.\n\nMy colleagues, working together with the corporate responsibility group As You Sow, took a look at packaging in fast food and quick service restaurants (from McDonalds to Pr\u00c3\u00aat \u00c3\u00a0 Manger), beverage companies, grocery chains and other food retailers. They found that most of the 47 companies they studied, many of which had established corporate sustainability programs, fail to fully account for the environmental impacts of their packaging--especially to what happens to their packaging after it's used.\n\nEvery year in the United States, the paper, aluminum, glass, plastics and other recyclable material we throw away would be worth $11.4 billion if it were recycled instead. Less than 14 percent of plastic packaging, which is the fastest-growing form of packaging, gets recycled. In addition to being a real waste of materials, single-use food and beverage packaging is a prime source of the estimated 269,000 tons of plastic pollution currently floating around in the world's oceans, harming turtles, whales, seabirds and other marine life, as possibly human health as well.",
  "summary": "The post discusses the issue of packaging waste, particularly fast food trash, and highlights the environmental impact of single-use food and beverage packaging, particularly plastic. The author expresses concern about the lack of accountability from companies in addressing the environmental impacts of their packaging. The sentiment about banning plastic straws is likely to be supportive, considering the negative effects of plastic packaging on the environment. \nSentiment: 0.9",
