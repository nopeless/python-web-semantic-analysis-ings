Paper straws, the current replacement for plastic straws, suffer from drawbacks, such as a high cost of the water-proof wax layer and poor water stability due to the easy delamination of the wax layer. It is therefore crucial to find a high-performing alternative to mitigate the environmental problems brought by plastic straws. In this paper, all natural, degradable, cellulose-lignin reinforced composite straws, inspired by the reinforcement principle of cellulose and lignin in natural wood are developed. The cellulose-lignin reinforced composite straw is fabricated by rolling up a wet film made of homogeneously mixed cellulose microfibers, cellulose nanofibers, and lignin powders, which is then baked in oven at 150 \u00b0C. When baked, lignin melts and infiltrates the micro\u2013nanocellulose network, acting as a polyphenolic binder to improve the mechanical strength and hydrophobicity performance of the resulting straw. The obtained straws demonstrate several advantageous properties over paper straws, including 1) excellent mechanical performance, 2) high hydrostability, and 3) low cost. Moreover, the natural degradability of the cellulose-lignin reinforced composite straws makes them promising candidates to replace plastic straws and suggests possible substitutes for other petroleum-based plastics.\n\nConflict of Interest\n- The authors declare no conflict of interest.\n\nOpen Research\n\nSupporting Information\n\nReferences\n\nCiting Literature\n\nVolume17, Issue18\n\nMay 6, 2021\n\n2008011\n\nReferences\n\nRelated Information\n\nDownload PDF\n\nAdditional links\n\nABOUT WILEY ONLINE LIBRARY\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nTerms of Use\n\nAbout Cookies\n\nManage Cookies\n\nAccessibility\n\nWiley Research DE&I Statement and Publishing Policies\n\nDeveloping World Access\n\nHELP & SUPPORT\n\nContact Us\n\nTraining and Support\n\nDMCA & Reporting Piracy\n- OPPORTUNITIES\nSubscription Agents\nAdvertisers & Corporate Partners\n\nCONNECT WITH WILEY\nThe Wiley Network\nWiley Press Room\nCopyright \u00a9 1999-2023 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

  "summary": "The post discusses the development of strong, hydrostable, and degradable straws made from cellulose-lignin reinforced composites as an alternative to single-use plastic straws. The authors emphasize the advantages of these new straws over traditional paper straws, including excellent mechanical performance, high hydrostability, and low cost, as well as their potential to mitigate environmental issues caused by plastic straws. The sentiment about banning plastic straws in this context is positive, as it promotes the use of more sustainable and environmentally friendly alternatives. \n\nSentiment: 0.9",
