  "readable_content": "- rib_eye_b (2017-09-27): Does anyone have any tips on removing wrinkles from the clear plastic of a blu-ray case? These wrinkles are annoying. Anyone know a trick to smooth things out?\n- CaptainGibb (2017-09-27): Honestly just get new cases. Casetopia is a great source. The cases are super cheap so dont be surprised when shipping is a little hefty. Still a great deal\n   - zackryderwoos (2017-09-27): How did it get to look like that in the first place?",
