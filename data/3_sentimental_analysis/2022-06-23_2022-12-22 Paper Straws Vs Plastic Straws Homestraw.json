This comparison sheds light on the advantages and disadvantages of each type of straw, offering a comprehensive view of their environmental impact.\n\n- The plastic straw is a tube-shaped, single-used straw commonly used as a drinking straw worldwide. The primary material used for the manufacturing of plastic straws is polypropylene, which provides strength, slipperiness, flexibility, and moisture resistance. Plasticizers are also used to make the straws soft and flexible. However, plastic straws are non-biodegradable, non-recyclable, and non-compostable, and they contribute to pollution in both their manufacturing and disposal.\n\n- Paper straws are tube-shaped alternatives to plastic straws, typically made of food-grade kraft paper that is oil-proof, moisture-proof, and hygienic. These straws are biodegradable, renewable, and compostable, presenting a more sustainable option. However, paper straws are less durable and easily deformed compared to their plastic counterparts.\n\n- The passage also mentions the disadvantages of plastic straws, including their non-recyclability and non-biodegradability, which contribute to environmental pollution.
