  "readable_content": "- Arctureas (2021-12-08): I prefer paper/cardboard straws to plastic ones. You know, the ones they recently replaced the plastic straws with at Starbucks, McDonalds, Capri-Sonne's, etc. All my friends look at me as if I just murdered someone whenever I tell them I prefer them to the plastic ones. Honestly it comes down to the feeling. I don't have the problem with them disintegrating, and they feel much better in the mouth than the plastic ones. The environmental factor is a plus I suppose, but with the tons of plastic we use every year, it seems like a negligible effect replacing plastic straws with cardboard have anyway. I simply prefer how they feel.\n\n- FatherJodorowski (2021-12-08): I like the metal ones, I like how they clank on my teeth.\n\n- Cauhs (2021-12-08): The mythical 13th dentist.\n\n- watermoonj (2021-12-08): they immediately get soggy and then they just stop working after a while. 7-eleven has biodegradable plastic ones that work just fine, idk why places don\u2019t just start using those\n\n- FutureKnightMaybe (2021-12-08): Remember as a kid when you would eat a bunch of Pixie Stix at once? Then you\u2019d accidentally touch the open end of one to your tongue, and then it would be a struggle to get the sugar out? That\u2019s what paper straws also do, but at a slower rate. Luckily I drink most things quickly, but the times that I have tried to enjoy myself and sip I end up with cardboard flavored drink :( I also enjoy the resilience of plastic straws, you can bend them but they don\u2019t break easily. Also makes a good chewing device that helps me focus.\n\n- Shenlong1904 (2021-12-08): This, people call it a problem, but chewing on plastic straws helps me distress myself on a spiritual level\n\n- languagelover17 (2021-12-08): Ugh go back to hell please\n\n- Blasphoumy69 (2021-12-08): Paper makes the drink taste like paper and it feels terrible in my mouth\n\n- NoDonut9078 (2021-12-08): I doubt the environmental impact is actually much of a difference. If I recall the straws are wrapped in plastic, whereas plastic straws were wrapped in paper. But I still prefer plastic straws as a mouth feel. I rarely use a straw so this isn\u2019t my argument.\n\n- thommyjohnst (2021-12-08): Downvote, yeah me too. Far better for the environment; feel fine.\n\n- iytyu (2021-12-08): I actually hated this so much I instinctively downvoted before remembering the rules. Take your upvote and get out.\n\n- sax_master225 (2021-12-08): Honestly why use straws anyways in most cases. Like if I'm at a restaurant I just want to drink straight from the cup. All straws are inherently worse unless its something like a frappuccino where you actually need one.\n\n- KaseyT1203 (2021-12-08): Capri-Sonne's are only drinkable with straws. But then, why drink a Capri-Sonne anyway?\n\n- jedi21knight (2021-12-08): Eww. I stopped using straws for the most part but I totally prefer the plastic ones. The paper straws do as they should and get soft and bendy or whatever I hate that",
