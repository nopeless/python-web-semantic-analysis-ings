  "readable_content": "- ispankyi (2015-12-08): I work in the Costco Food Court. AMA!\n- suarezj9 (2015-12-08): Why are there never any chicken bakes ready when I go on break?\n- Spcarson05 (2015-12-08): Why the hell did they get rid of the chocolate ice cream bar?\n- vpjoebauers (2015-12-08): Do you have any power to change the name of the pizza with everything to something like 'supreme'? This dumb ass in front of me this weekend could not understand that a combo pizza did not come with a drink...And argued until a manager came up.\n- BoredAccountant (2015-12-08): Why can't I get just a hot dog? Like, if I want three hot dogs, I don't want three drinks.\n- sqdnleader (2015-12-08): How many people are in your court and how smoothly does it run?\n- Ayos (2015-12-08): I discovered that you can ask for Saukrat when you order a hot dog. Are there any other secrets we should know about?\n- Sonic343 (2015-12-08): When are you getting french fries?\n- toxicbrew (2015-12-08): Why no sausage pizza?\n- vgdiv (2015-12-08): What takes the longest to make - in other words what should I not order if there's a line\n- 5krunner (2015-12-08): Why do most Costco food courts not sell coffee? I would buy more stuff at Costco if I had more caffeine coursing through my veins!\n- memebuster (2015-12-08): Is it true the pizzas are made by a machine? I saw a youtube video that claimed it was in Costcos.\n- gosassin (2015-12-08): At my Costco (not an employee, just a member) there's a window into the kitchen and you can see the cooks make the pies by hand. They do have a machine that sauces the dough, though. EDIT: I kind of want that machine for myself.\n- [deleted] (2015-12-08): What's the most disgusting thing you've ever witnessed another co-worker do while in the kitchen? Has someone ever dropped some food and still used it for cooking?\n- jahesus (2015-12-08): Can I get the recipe for the chicken bakes?\n- ispankyi (2015-12-08): Pizza dough, chicken, Caesar dressing, bacon, Parmesan cheese, olive oil.\n- natemc (2015-12-08): Why is my chicken bake almost completely bread on one side? I stopped buying them for this reason.\n- ispankyi (2015-12-08): Because the person making it isn't making it as directed. They are probably making them as fast as they can. Mention it to a manager they should fix that pretty quick.\n- SEA_tide (2015-12-08): Why'd they remove the gelato from most of the test food courts but kept it at 2-5 \"special\" Costcos? The pistachio and strawberry flavors are amazing and 3 huge scoops in a waffle cone for $1.50 is a great deal.\n- SEA_tide (2015-12-08): Are you a brisket or chili food court? Is your food court outside? Do you ever work anywhere other than the food court?\n- [deleted] (2015-12-08): Why are some stores moving away from members prealigning their purchases in the cart and scangunning them all in the cart? I've been told it was to reduce shrink, but I don't get the reasoning behind that.",
