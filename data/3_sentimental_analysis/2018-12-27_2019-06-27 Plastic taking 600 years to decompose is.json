  "readable_content": "- [deleted] (2018-12-08): Plastic taking 600 years to decompose is actually not bad at all. If it\u2019s buried in a sensible place and not thrown in the ocean I have zero issue with this.\n  - [deleted] (2018-12-08): The time it takes for plastic to decompose is irrelevant. It's the toxicity of the plastic that is concerning. When plastic is buried in a landfill, those toxic chemicals start to break down, and seep into the water. Water treatment plants cannot remove chemicals like BPA, and therefore is in our drinking water.\n  - [deleted] (2018-12-08): And its not possible to bury plastic in an area where the groundwater has minimal interaction with drinking water? Like if groundwater in an area goes out to sea - where it would be heavily diluted and breaks down extremely slowly anyway. So would have no impact on wildlife.\n    - SpiderNeko (2018-12-08): The problem is if that plastic ends up reaching ground water and polluting things like the wells in people's back yards or streams/lakes. It's hard to bury something like that and have no issues arise.\n    - jaspnlv (2018-12-08): Trash to energy is a better solution\n  - UnpopularOpinionMods (2018-12-08): Is this a Popular or Unpopular opinion? Please reply to this comment with either 'popular' or 'unpopular'\n    - billybitchtitsdotorg (2018-12-08): I think its longer than that\n  - [deleted] (2018-12-08): Google tells me 10-1000. Planet is 6 billion years old. All irrelevant\n  - [deleted] (2018-12-08): are plastics made from hemp or algae less toxic?",
