Australian scientists Hardesty and Chris Wilcox estimate, using trash collected on U.S. coastlines during clean ups over five years, that there are nearly 7.5 million plastic straws lying around America's shorelines.\u00a0 They then figure that means for the entire world there are between 437 million and 8.3 billion plastic straws on the world's coastlines. (CSIRO via AP)\n...\nMcDonald's will test paper straws in some U.K. locations next month and keep all straws behind the counter, so customers have to ask for them. \"Together with our customers we can do our bit for the environment and use fewer straws,\" says Paul Pomroy, who runs the fast-food company's U.K. business.\n\nThe issue of straws and marine animals got more heated after a 2015 viral video showing rescuers removing a straw from a sea turtle's nose in graphic and bloody detail.\n\nBut a ban may be a bit of a straw man in the discussions about plastics pollution. Straws make up about 4 percent of the plastic trash by piece, but far less by weight.\n\nStraws on average weigh so little\u2014about one sixty-seventh of an ounce or .42 grams\u2014that all those billions of straws add up to only about 2,000 tons of the nearly 9 million tons of plastic waste that yearly hits the waters.\n\n\"Bans can play a role,\" says oceanographer Kara Lavendar Law, a co-author with Jambeck of the 2015 Science study. \"We are not going to solve the problem by banning straws.\"\n\nIn this Thursday, Feb. 12, 2015 file photo, Jenna Jambeck, an environment engineering professor at the University of Georgia, holds a plastic baggie with trash collected last fall from a clean up at Panama Beach, Fla., at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in San Jose, Calif. Jambeck calculates that nearly 9 million tons (8 million metric tons) end up in the world's oceans and on the coastlines each year, as of 2010, according to her 2015 study. (AP Photo/Seth Borenstein)\n\nScientists say that unless you are disabled or a small child, plastic straws are generally unnecessary and a ban is start and good symbol. These items that people use for a few minutes but \"are sticking round for our lifetime and longer,\" Lippiatt says.\n\nMarcus Eriksen, an environmental scientist who co-founded the advocacy group 5 Gyres, says working on bans of straws and plastic bags would bring noticeable change. He calls plastic bags, cups and straws that break down in smaller but still harmful pieces the \"smog of microplastics.\"\n\n\"Our cities are horizontal smokestacks pumping out this smog into the seas,\" Eriksen says. \"One goal for advocacy organizations is to make that single-use culture taboo, the same way smoking in public is taboo.\"\n\nSteve Russell, vice president of plastics for the American Chemistry Council, said people can reduce waste by not taking straws, but \"in many cases these plastics provide sanitary conditions for food, beverages and personal care.\"\n\nThe key to solving marine litter, Russell says, is \"in investing in systems to capture land-based waste and investing in infrastructure to convert used plastics into valuable products.\"\n\nEven though Jambeck spends her life measuring and working on the growing problem of waste pollution, she's optimistic.\n\n\"We can do this,\" Jambeck says. \"I have faith in humans.\"\n\nJournal information: Science \n\n\u00a9 2018 The Associated Press.

  "summary": "The post discusses the impact of plastic straws on the environment and the measures being taken to reduce their usage, such as testing paper straws and implementing bans. It also highlights the view of some experts that while banning straws is a good symbol, it is not a complete solution to the problem of plastic pollution. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean towards the necessity of reducing the use of plastic straws for the betterment of the environment. Sentiment: 0.7",
