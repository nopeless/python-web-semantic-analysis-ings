The Lonely Whale Foundation\u2019s \u2018Strawless in Seattle\u2019 campaign resulted in the elimination of 2.3 million disposable plastic straws in the month of September in that city. As of July 1, 2018, Seattle will ban non-compostable plastic straws and cutlery from 3,100 food service businesses that range from Starbucks to sports stadiums. Lonely Whale will take its strawless campaign to at least 10 more cities next year.\nIn the latest episode of Deeply Talks, Todd Woody, News Deeply\u2019s executive editor for environment, moderates a discussion about the straw ban and efforts to get people to \u2018stop sucking\u2019 with Dune Ives, executive director of the Lonely Whale Foundation, Susan Fife-Ferris, director of solid waste planning and program management for Seattle Public Utilities and David Rhodes, global business director for paper straw maker Aardvark.\nWhy focus on straws?\n\u2018When I took a look at ways to bring people closer to the ocean and raise awareness about ocean health issues and specifically marine litter, we wanted to find that one item that was really ubiquitous for all of us in our everyday experiences,\u2019 said Ives, \u2018for which there was a readily available acceptable alternative that could be acted upon very quickly by every person.\u2019\nFor the city of Seattle, straws were the last straw in a decade-long effort to replace plastic and Styrofoam packaging and utensils used by food service businesses with sustainable alternatives. \u2018There are many certified compostable straws in the marketplace now,\u2019 said Fife-Ferris.\nWhile the city will allow compostable plastic straws, such straws can only be composted in industrial facilities and will not biodegrade if they get into the ocean. Paper straws made by Aardvark, however, are marine biodegradable, according to Rhodes.\nBut it\u2019s not really about straws, the panelists emphasized, it\u2019s about using them to change attitudes toward a throwaway culture that has led to the ocean plastic pollution crisis.\n\u2018The ingenuity of addressing something as small and common as a straw, something so often used without thought with a wasteful impact, is that it allows us to look at our wasteful behaviors and consider what else we carelessly and needlessly use,\u2019 said Fife-Ferris.\"\n\n- NewsBot (2023-12-08):\n  - Todd Woody is executive editor for environment at News Deeply.
