  "readable_content": "- ImLivingAmongYou (2017-02-19): Scotland plans to ban plastic straws by end of 2019\n  - fortyeightD: If anyone complains about this, just tell them to suck it up.\n  - protepojken: I can\u2019t stop thinking about that poor turtle with a straw in its nose. Therefore: Yes\n  - benbroady: Straws are kind of a luxury anyway most of the time. 90% of the time I see them used they're unnecessary. Just pick up your drink and sip it normally.\n- ImLivingAmongYou (2017-02-19): For those who want to take waste reduction like this in their own hands, you should check out r/ZeroWaste. They take a holistic approach to reducing your consumption, waste, and overall impact.\n  - calgaryflamer: Good. Saw this video of a sea turtle with a straw stuck up its nostrils. Looked unbearably painful for them to take it out.\n  - n00dol: I recycle and am doing my little part as we all should, however, I feel like it makes little to no difference at all.\n    - [deleted]: There's over 300 million people in this country, collectively it does make a difference.\n  - losersalwayswin: my job switched to paper straws and charging a nickel for flatware...\n    - thebouncehouse123: So it's working?\n  - Opothleyahola: I remember paper straws and they suck, literally and figuratively, but I'm fine with a ban on them. There should be a ban on plastic bags and plastic bottles too.\n  - Middleman86: Cmon America, get off your tractors and get with the program. We need to do this. Save those poor turtles n\u2019shit\n  - Northwindlowlander: These stories tell you a lot about scottish people...\n    - betona: All straws were paper up to the 1960s or so. They worked okay so far as I can remember.\n      - - betona: Failing that, how about grown-up sippy cups?",
