  "body": "GOODBYE, PLASTIC STRAWS \ud83d\udc4b McDonald's Philippines has started introducing sippy cups or strawless lids in select stores in Metro Manila this June. This move is in line with the company's goal of significantly reducing its plastic waste by using less straws. This thread is archived",
  "readable_content": "- bikomonster (2023-12-08): Plastic straws are not the problem, it\u2019s the use of plastic. That lid is still single use plastic, and will still contribute to the waste. This is just a corporation pretending to care. And it\u2019s at the expense of consumers.\n- RadioactiveReindeer (2023-12-08): So what's a good viable and sustainable solution for this?\n    - [deleted] (2023-12-08): Pero yung lid is plastic...\n    - grinsken (2023-12-08): Single use padin naman yan eh.\n    - [deleted] (2023-12-08): I feel like the plastic used on the straw was just transformed to the extra plastic on the lid lmao\n    - Boy_Martirez (2023-12-08): I hope the lid is tight enough. Baka pag-inom mo....\n    - Menter33 (2023-12-08): Good luck trying to drink something while driving; w/o straws, this will look like an accident waiting to happen.\n    - Magnelume (2023-12-08): Cool, I guess... but I\u2019ll just keep bringing my own tumbler and straw.\n    - ZiangoRex (2023-12-08): hehe we all know they're only doing this to save more money.",
