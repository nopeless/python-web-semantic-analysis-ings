(Reuters)\n\nAlthough nobody could doubt the selfless dedication of the thousands who took part, some activists argue that such volunteer clean-ups are not the best way to tackle the plastic pollution that is choking rivers, destroying once-beautiful beaches and costing the lives of whales, seabirds and other wildlife.\n\nCritics argue that public cleanups do not address the root causes of this pollution. Cleaning a beach is not turning the tide, they say, because the tide will just come in again, depositing more plastic cups, bottles, straws, bags and discarded fishing equipment. What we need to do, they argue, is reduce unnecessary plastic at source, design less harmful products and develop better recycling processes.\n\nDavid Katz, the founder and CEO of The Plastic Bank, which monetizes plastic waste by turning it into a currency that helps some of the world\u2019s poorest people, likens the problem to an overflowing sink: there is no point in mopping the floor until you turn off the tap.\n\nHowever, there is compelling evidence that cleanup campaigns, like the Great Plastic Pick Up, do make a difference and not just in the short term.\n\nEvery piece of trash that is taken away to be recycled or deposited in a landfill means there is one less dangerous item for birds, turtles or whales to swallow. Cleanups also restore these creatures\u2019 habitats.\n\nDavid Katz, the founder and CEO of The Plastic Bank\u00a0has argued that there's no point cleaning up plastic waste until we address the problem at its source. (\u00a9The Plastic Bank)\n\nOne need look no further than Versova beach in Mumbai. In 2015, lawyer Afroz Shah decided he had to act after moving into an apartment overlooking the beach and realizing the extent of the plastic pollution. He started picking up the rubbish with a friend and since then his weekend cleans have attracted scores of volunteers who have removed around 13 million kgs of waste in what the UN has called \u201cthe world\u2019s largest beach cleanup project\u201d.\n\nIn March, it was payback time after all the back-breaking, filthy work. Volunteers spotted around 80 olive ridley turtle hatchlings heading towards the sea. The vulnerable turtles had not been seen on the beach for decades. Volunteers slept by the nests to protect them from predators and made sure the baby turtles could make their way safely to the sea.\n\nBeach cleanups also serve to educate. When volunteers see just how much plastic is deposited on our shores, they are often inspired to reduce their reliance on single-use plastics, and, crucially, to spread the word to others.\n\nTiza Mafira, lawyer and director of the non-profit Indonesia Plastic Bag Diet Movement, says beach cleanups give volunteers a clear sense of the scale of the problem.\n\nThe olive ridley turtle is one of the many marine species threatened by plastic pollution. (Reuters)\n\n\u201cThat alone can be a shock treatment but it needs to be accompanied with an educational or follow-up action. Otherwise, the shock treatment alone may leave volunteers feeling helpless,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cWhen we do beach or river clean-ups we always make sure that volunteers carry a non-plastic sack to contain the waste and we provide them with lunch wrapped in banana leaf and remind them to bring tumblers to show there are alternatives to plastic \u2026 There are also a number of ways you can sort and measure the waste afterwards, by type or by brand. This empowers volunteers to tell the government or call out specific industry brands that use these plastic packagings \u2026 Hopefully, this provides lasting behavioural changes,\u201d she adds.\n\nProfessor Richard Thompson, professor of marine biology at the University of Plymouth, says that although beach cleans are not the sole answer to the plastic problem, he is in favour of them.\n\n\u201cMy experience is that new volunteers join beach cleans all the time. This is important because they help to raise awareness more broadly. Our research at the University of Plymouth has shown volunteers also get a rewarding experience from helping to take positive action,\u201d he says.\n\nAs Mafira notes, cleanup campaigns sometimes collect data on the litter found to determine where it comes from and thus aid longer-term efforts to cut down on marine plastic pollution. For example, the British Science Association and The Plastic Tide charity have asked the public to help chart plastic pollution by tagging items captured by drone technology and aerial photos taken of Britain\u2019s shores. They hope to get more than 250,000 images tagged to build a tool that can measure how much marine litter there is and where it comes from.\n\nThere are also economic benefits to public cleanups. If beaches are covered with litter, tourists will not come. Last November, the Indonesian island of Bali declared a \u201cgarbage emergency\u201dacross a six-kilometer stretch of coast, with authorities forced to deploy cleaners and trucks to take around 100 tons of waste every day to a nearby landfill.\n\nIndonesia, which is the world\u2019s second-biggest source of marine pollution after China, has signed up to the UN\u2019s Clean Seas campaign and pledged to reduce marine plastic waste by 70 per cent by 2025. It plans to curb the use of plastic bags, boost recycling services and launch cleanup campaigns.\n\nSome islanders are already hard at work. In February, One Island One Voice, an umbrella group that organizes regular beach clean-ups, got more than 20,000 people to tackle the rubbish on 120 beaches around Bali.\n\nMumbai's Versova Beach has been the site of an enormous beach clean-up, but the pollution problem persists. (UN Environment)\n\nEven if there is merit to the argument that the tap needs to be turned off before mopping the floor, there can be no denying the fact that volunteer cleanups protect wildlife, create momentum, raise awareness and save threatened habitats. It is nonetheless critical to make sure one seeks a long-term cure even while dealing with the symptoms of this toxic pollution.\n\n\u201cIf I were advising a wealthy investor on where to place their money in order to have maximum effect, I would say invest 95 per cent in ways to prevent plastic litter from entering the oceans. Otherwise, we will be cleaning up forever, as will our children and our children\u2019s children,\u201d Professor Thompson says.\n\nPlastic pollution of our rivers and seas is a monumental, multifaceted problem with global consequences. There is no silver bullet and no single activity can turn back the clock. However, public engagement appears critical to encourage behaviour change and increase pressure on governments and businesses to take action.\n\nAs with all the existential environmental challenges we face today, everyone has a role to play if the tide is to be definitively turned. You might not have a science degree, or a role in government, but we can all pick up t",
  "summary": "The text presents a balanced view on the effectiveness of volunteer cleanups in addressing plastic pollution. While some argue that these efforts may not tackle the root causes of the issue, others emphasize the positive impact of cleanups on raising awareness, protecting wildlife, and influencing behavior change. Overall, the text implies that while cleanups may not be the sole solution, they play a crucial role in the broader effort to combat plastic pollution. Sentiment: 0.5",
