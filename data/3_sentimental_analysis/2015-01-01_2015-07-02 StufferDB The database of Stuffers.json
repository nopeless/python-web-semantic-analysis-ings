Hello, just wanted to ask about this issue I'm experiencing for several years now. Every single video from stufferdb is loading so slowly for me it renders almost everything unwatchable. Even if I wait and let it buffer for some time, it always gets to the point where I have to wait several seconds to load a second of the video. Is this a global issue or just my problem? If it's not global, has anyone experienced this and is there a fix? My internet speed is 100 MB/s so the problem is not there.\n- 89throwaway8989 (2022-10-08): longest video? Site Questions. Just wanna know where the longest video is.\n- Traditional-Ad5655 (2022-10-08): Does Laura lee have any more than the 5 videos on this website?\n- ChickenChipotleMelt (2022-10-08): Does StuffersDB completely devour anyone else's data for the month? I would like to start off by saying I watched maybe one or two videos and not even all the way, I skipped through them and maybe some pictures too, yet my bandwidth shows over 125+ gigs of data being used. The night before that, I had 250+ gigs of usage. I used to notice that StufferDB would use a lot of data a long time ago but I figured it was a fluke but now I'm seeing that this may be directly linked to StufferDB since it seems to always spike when I go on there. Anyone else have this issue even when they do not watch many videos on there?\n- Lightrunner2004 (2022-10-08): Is the website down for anybody else? Just tried going on the website on was met with a blank white screen. Tried using one of the image results to access the website and got an error screen about a server problem. Is anybody else having this issue?\n- jftlove (2022-10-08): What happened to Azismiss's content?\n- CpoleC (2019-08-08): Does anyone know how to fix this.\n- slrrp (2019-08-08): Is the site down?\n- praisepigday (2019-08-08): Videos not loading.
