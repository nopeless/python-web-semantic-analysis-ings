  "body": "The most energy efficient setup is T3 assemblers with 3 efficiency3 modules and one speed3 module. So only 22.4 kJ per recipe second. meneldal2 \u2022 7 yr. ago. You can go lower if you put more beacons with speed and efficiency. Though the beacon cost is important as well.",
  "readable_content": "- RedditNamesAreShort (2023-12-08): The general formula to calculate energy usage per recipe second I used for this post:\n\nw = power consumption of machine in kW (without module bonus)\ns = crafting speed of machine (without module bonus)\np = number of prod3 modules in machine\nb = number of speed3 beacons affecting one machine\nm = number of machines each beacon affects\n(w*(1 + b*0.7 + p*0.8)+(b*480/m))/((1 + -0.15*p + 0.5*b)*(1 + p*0.1)*s)\n\nThe results are all calculated with wolframalpha. You should be able to just copy & paste the formulae to verify them for yourself. The values in this post are lower bounds as they do assume no assembler downtime and inserter energy costs. Also tileable designs that rely on beacon sharing between modules (3-5) are assumed to always share all beacons. \n\n- madmaster5000 (2023-12-08): Nice followup to your other post. This is quite informative for anyone setting up a megabase build. This is the energy cost per recipe second for a couple other layouts.
