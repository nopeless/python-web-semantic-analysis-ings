Typically made out of plant-based materials, often agricultural byproducts. You might see biodegradable and compostable straws in your local restaurant or coffee shop and you can buy these drinking straws for your own use. With so many types of biodegradable and compostable straws on the market, it's important to know the difference between biodegradable and compostable straws so you can choose which option best fits your eco-friendly lifestyle. Here's what we'll go over in this guide:\nAre compostable straws biodegradable?\nHow long does it take biodegradable straws to break down?\nTypes of biodegradable straws\n8 best biodegradable straws you should switch to\nTop 5 FAQs about biodegradable straws\nBefore we get into the different types of biodegradable drinking straws, let's discuss compostable straws and if they are biodegradable products. We'll also talk about how long it takes these biodegradable straws to break down.\nAre compostable straws biodegradable?\nMany eco-friendly straws are labeled compostable, biodegradable, or both. Biodegradable simply means that the straw will break down over an unspecified amount of time. Technically, any material is biodegradable over time and depends on the environment. Compostable materials must degrade into a nutrient-rich substance at a certain rate. For straws to be considered compostable, they need to be certified compostable. This means they are made of organic materials. Biodegradable straws simply refer to any material that breaks down and degrades in the environment.\nHow long does it take biodegradable straws to break down?\nMost things are considered biodegradable, even plastic. Often companies will use biodegradable plastics or bioplastics instead of petroleum-based plastic for their products. Biodegradable straws take anywhere from a few months to a few years to break down, depending on the materials used to create them. Breaking down biodegradable straws doesn\u2019t have to be complicated or even take years. Using an electric composter, like Lomi, is a quick and easy way to turn food scraps and Lomi-approved biodegradable materials into nutrient-rich fertilizer for your plants in as little as 4 hours.\u00a0\nTypes of biodegradable straws\nAs more companies move to be more green, there are many new types of biodegradable products available. We're no longer limited to just flimsy paper straws that will fall apart while stirring cold beverages. Here are some of the different kinds of biodegradable straws you can buy.\nPaper straws: Paper straws are probably the most common biodegradable drinking straw you'll find.

You can wash and reuse them for a while before having to toss them in the compost bin.\nWheat straws: Wheat straws are made from wheat stems. This material is usually treated as waste so converting this \u2018waste\u2019 into straws allows for saving natural resources.\nSugarcane straws: Just like wheat straws, sugarcane straws are made from agricultural byproducts. Sugarcane straws hold up to both hot and cold beverages.\nPLA straws:\u00a0 PLA straws are often made out of corn plastic- a non-petroleum material made by converting corn into resin. PLA straws require industrial composting conditions and are not home-compostable.\nAgave straws: Agave fiber drinking straws are made of agave stems as the byproduct of tequila production.\n\n50+ Easy Tips to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint\nDownload this FREE resource to find and incorporate small changes to your daily routines that can make a positive difference to the planet!\nFREE DOWNLOAD\n\n8 best biodegradable straws you should switch to\nNow that you know the different types of biodegradable straws out there, let's look at some of the most eco-friendly, biodegradable, and compostable straws you should switch to in order to kick plastic straws to the curb.\u00a0\n1.
