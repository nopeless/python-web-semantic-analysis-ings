  "readable_content": "- RDMvb6 (2015-12-08): How to get the balls back in the ball screw?\n\nDespite all the warnings I heard, I'm an idiot and in trying to reverse the ball nut, it came off the screw while I tried to get it onto another (printed) piece used to reverse it. So I recovered all (I hope) of the balls but now I can't figure out how to get it back into the nut and onto the screw. There is also a small white gasket that came off. Its this one from aliexpress:\n\nhttp://www.aliexpress.com/item/CNC-Linear-SFU-1204-BallScrew-Set-1pc-RM1204-L-330mm-1pc-SFU1204-Ball-Screw-Anti-Backlash/1588647624.html\n\nAny help would be great. It's (only) a $30 part but the lead time is a pain and I would rather not replace it. Thanks!\n\n- Lars0 (2015-12-08): You poor bastard.\n\n- Sgt_45Bravo (2015-12-08): I've never had to do that, but this video seems to give an idea of how to do it.\n\n- The3rdWorld (2015-12-08): thought this was a post from r/BDSM...\n\nbut seriously that looks an annoying task, i've never seen one of them but you might be able to use a little magic trick of sitting the bolt on a powerful magnet, this forms a magnetic field through the metal and will hold the balls in place if they're metal - possible pick them up by sucking on a thin straw, push them into position and release them letting the magnet hold them... this is one of those things that sometimes works wonders other times is just frustrating, sometimes the magnet will hold things where you want them and other times it'll move them to where you don-t - moving the magnet can help.\n\nOtherwise if they're not to heavy balls (like plastic or alu maybe) you might consider getting a bit of Vaseline or grease and using that to hold them in place after locating them with a straw or toothpick? all depends on the final use and tolerances of it.\n\nAt work we'd carefully place an item like that on floor and give it a sharp tap with a hammer so it's totally messed up and we can throw it away guiltless....\n\nedit, just watched the video - much larger than i'd assumed it was, that method he uses seems good - for a task like that my best advice is put on an audio book or music you enjoy listening to and don't rush - probably organize everything into piles first so you'll know exactly how many should be in each section, etc\n\n- VDechS (2015-12-08): I've repacked a gazillion ball nuts. It's dead easy. Just use a very slim tool or small screwdriver, very good lighting and bearing grease to pick up and place the balls. Start on one channel, slather the tool tip with grease then pick up one ball bearing. Place the ball in a channel. You can either place the next ball in an open position or push the previous ball to the return then repeat. Once this channel is filled, move on the next channel. With heavy bearing grease the ball bearings will stick to the sides so there is no need to use a shaft. Just don't bang the ballnut around and you can complete this quickly with a little care and patience. Putting the shaft in is where you have to be really really careful. You are ok long as you don't misalign the ballscrew while putting it in but if you force it in at an angle you'll knock some balls loose.\n\n- ryobiguy (2015-12-08): How do those feel for $30 a pair? Any backlash?\n",
