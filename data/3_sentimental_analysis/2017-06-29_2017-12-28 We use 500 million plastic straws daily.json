That has multiple parts to it. Ultimately, our goal is to eliminate 500 million single-use plastic straws during 2017.\n- Dune Ives: \n  - \"I don\u2019t know that there is an 'average day' of work at the Lonely Whale. That\u2019s the nature of the work, right? We have to remain nimble and be willing to be flexible in our approach...\"",
