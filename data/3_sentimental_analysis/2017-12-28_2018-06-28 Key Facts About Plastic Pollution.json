  "readable_content": "Greenpeace USA (2018-06-08): \n\nKey Facts About Plastic Pollution\n\nArm yourself with knowledge about one of the biggest threats to our oceans.\n\nIn the US, Greenpeace activists deployed two messages near the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco that read \u201cBreak Free From Plastic\u201d and \u201cStop Corporate Plastic Pollution\u201d. \u201cWe are reaching a tipping point on single-use plastics, and it is time for any corporation that cares about a healthy planet to go beyond recycling alone. Throwaway plastics continue to pour into our oceans, our waterways, and our communities at an alarming rate,\u201d said Graham Forbes, a Plastics Campaigner at Greenpeace USA.\n\n---\n\nGeorge Nikitin: What is the current state of the plastic pollution crisis?\n\n- About 8.3 billion tonnes of plastic has been produced since the 1950s \u2013 the weight of roughly a billion elephants or 47 million blue whales.\n- Only about 9% of this plastic has been recycled, 12% has been burned and the remaining 79% has ended up in landfills or the environment.\n- Up to 12.7 million tonnes of plastic enters the oceans every year.\n- The equivalent of a truckload of plastic enters the oceans every minute.\n- There are five trillion pieces of plastic in our oceans \u2013 enough to circle the Earth over 400 times.\n- Countries like Canada, the U.S., and the UK export plastic waste to various countries in Asia and Africa, offloading their trash problem to other communities.\n\n---\n\nGeorge Nikitin: Who is most impacted by plastic pollution?\n\n- Scientists have documented 700 marine species affected by ocean plastic.\n- Up to 9 of 10 seabirds, 1 in 3 sea turtles and more than half of whale and dolphin species have ingested plastic.\n- In the Canadian Arctic, 87% of birds have ingested plastics of some sort.\n- Crustaceans tested at the ocean\u2019s deepest point, Mariana Trench, had ingested plastic.\n- People living along rivers and coastlines in China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam are the most impacted by plastic pollution.\n- Low-income communities face more health impacts near plastic production sites, have greater exposure to toxins and waste, and bear the brunt of the impacts of improper plastic disposal and incineration.\n- Henderson Island in the South Pacific is the most plastic polluted of any island recorded to date.\n\n---\n\nGeorge Nikitin: Who is to blame for the plastic pollution problem?\n\n- Annual plastic production has skyrocketed since the early 1950s, reaching 322 million tons in 2015.\n- Drink companies alone, such as Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestl\u00e9, produce over 500 billion single-use plastic bottles annually.\n- Well known coffee company Starbucks produces 4 billion coffee cups each year.\n- Tens of billions of bags of chips are sold each year by companies like Pepsi Co.\n\n---\n\nGeorge Nikitin: What are real solutions to plastic pollution?\n\n- Government bans and restrictions for unnecessary and damaging plastic products or activities. Legislative reuse targets.\n- Mandated Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations and strategies to make producers and companies responsible for the damage plastic causes to our environment, make them accountable for the entire lifecycle and true costs of their products.\n- Government and corporate investment in reuse models and new ways to deliver products using less or no packaging.\n- Corporate phase-out of production and use of single-use plastic products and throwaway product models.\n- A shift in dominant public mindsets away from our throwaway culture focused on convenience being equal to disposal, toward a vision of healthy, sustainable and more connected communities.\n\n---\n\nGeorge Nikitin: What are false solutions to plastic pollution?\n\n- Bioplastics are not as green as they seem, approach with caution.\n- Incineration creates other pollution and does not address the overproduction problem.\n- Recycling or disposal. Focusing on end of life like recycling or disposal \u2013 we can\u2019t recycle our way out of this crisis.\n- Clean up. While clean up efforts help reduce litter problems, they do not address the source of the problem and ignore the unseen plastic pollution \u2014 microplastics.\n- Throwaway alternatives. Replacing one single-use item with another does not necessarily solve the problem or help to address our throwaway culture.\n\n---\n\nGeorge Nikitin: Who is championing real solutions?\n\n- Around the world, various cities, countries, and regions are banning or proposing bans on different single-use plastics like Morocco\u2019s bag ban and the City of Vancouver, Canada\u2019s proposed coffee cup and styrofoam container ban.\n- More than 30 countries have either regional or country-wide bans on plastic bags, and dozens more have levied fees or taxes on disposable bags.\n- UK retailer Iceland committed to going plastic free for all of its own brand products.\n- Zero waste supermarkets are popping up in various cities in countries including the UK, Germany, Canada, the United States, Mexico, South Africa and more.\n\n- Endnotes are available in the original text.\n\n---",
  "summary": "The information provided by Greenpeace USA and George Nikitin reflects a strong sense of urgency and concern about the plastic pollution crisis, advocating for real solutions through government intervention, corporate responsibility, and a shift in public mindset. The emphasis on the environmental and social impacts of plastic pollution highlights the severity of the issue. However, there is also optimism expressed through examples of bans on single-use plastics and the rise of zero waste supermarkets as real solutions. Sentiment: 0.8",
