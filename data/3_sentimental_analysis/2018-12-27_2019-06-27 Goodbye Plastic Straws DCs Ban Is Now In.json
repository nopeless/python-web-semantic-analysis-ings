  "body": "The argument against banning plastic straw because an extremely small minority of the population has \"life hacked\" them and have become dependent on them - is patently absurd.

I\u2019m not aware of any alternative straw materials that provide the flexibility and safety to PWD that the current plastic ones have.\n\n- Ueatsoap (2018-12-08): I've already seen some bars phasing in paper straws to replace the plastic ones.\n\n- 17 more replies",
