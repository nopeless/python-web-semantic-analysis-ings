I sell lots of things on eBay and while it saves on packing to have 50 different box sizes, it really is a burden to keep all boxes stocked. So what I do is I buy boxes that will fit severally different items, even if that means I have to use more packing material because it\u2019s easier and cheaper than having so many different sizes on hand.\n  > \n  > 6 more replies\n  > \n  > - J_T_L_ (2018-12-08): \"Adapteri\" Is that finnish I see?

The planet isn't going to die from how many straws we use, the much bigger impact are the externalized costs corporations pass off without the consumers' knowledge.\n  >\n  > Like me driving less won't mean shit while barges are spewing crude between here and China. It's like, sure I can do my part but it won't mean shit without holding the real polluters accountable, and all the energy spent screaming at me is effort not being directed at them.\n  >\n  > Anyone else feel the same way about these green programs? Maybe they can explain it better than I have. I care about the environment and try to do my part but I feel like they are putting lipstick on a pig.\n  >\n  > 1 more reply\n  >\n  > - Coolmonster399 (2018-12-08): Here is a hot take, maybe this is not the problem either, it's the way we dispose of said plastic is the damn problem.\n  >\n  > 32 more replies\n  >\n  > - Kiaxia (2018-12-08): Plastic in whole is the problem and straws are included\n  >\n  > 55 more replies\n  >\n  > - PanchosLegend (2018-12-08): Not the *only problem\n  >\n  > [deleted] (2018-12-08): Plastic straws are not the only* problem.\n  >\n  > - Newnustart (2018-12-08): Straws are still a problem\n  >\n  > [deleted] (2018-12-08): Yeah, plastic straws are made of thinner material which breaks down more easily into microplastics.

I do think, \"Let's go green by getting rid of plastic packaging\" would get any traction. Let\u2019s replace single-use plastic straws...it hits closer to home.\n  \n    - BlueWildcat84 (2018-12-08): Straws are still a problem even with ridiculous waste like this. #TeamNoStraw\n\n      - meowza93 (2018-12-08): Not the only problem\n\n        [deleted] (2018-12-08): They are both part of the problem.\n\n        chemicalsam (2018-12-08): Well, they are part of the problem\n\n        Mizuxe621 (2018-12-08): The top 100 companies produce 71% of global carbon emissions",
