But when marine researchers have measured how much of this plastic is floating on the water\u2019s surface, swirling in offshore gyres\u2014most notably, the so-called Great Pacific Garbage Patch, between Hawaii and California\u2014they have only found quantities on the order of hundreds of thousands of tons, or roughly one per cent of all the plastic that has ever gone into the ocean. Part of the explanation for this is that all plastic eventually breaks down into microplastic, and, although this takes some polymers decades, others break down almost immediately, or enter the ocean as microplastic already (like the synthetic fibres that pill off your fleece jacket or yoga pants in the washing machine).\n\n- Scientists have recently found tiny pieces of plastic falling with the rain in the high mountains, including France\u2019s Pyrenees and the Colorado Rockies. British researchers collected amphipods (shrimplike crustaceans) from six of the world\u2019s deepest ocean trenches and found that eighty per cent of them had microplastic in their digestive tracts. These kinds of plastic fibres and fragments are smaller than poppy seeds and \u201cthe perfect size to enter the bottom of the food web,\u201d as Jennifer Brandon, an oceanographer at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, told me. \u201cThey have been shown to be eaten by mussels, by coral, by sea cucumbers, by barnacles, by lots of filter-feeding plankton.\u201d\n\n- But what happens to all the marine macroplastic\u2014big stuff, like buckets, toys, bottles, toothbrushes, flip-flops\u2014before it breaks down? Since most macroplastic has not been found floating at the surface, its location has, for many years, remained a mystery to scientists. \u201cThe question that everyone in the community has is, \u2018Where is all the plastic?\u2019 \u201d Erik van Sebille, an oceanographer who is leading a major five-year mapping project called topios, or Tracking of Plastic in Our Seas, told me. He calls the missing ninety-nine per cent \u201cdark plastic.\u201d It\u2019s the dark matter of the sea.\n\n- Van Sebille has compared the problem to the discussion around carbon-dioxide emissions thirty years ago. Back then, scientists could see that people were adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, but it was unclear where all the carbon dioxide was coming from. \u201cWe could only really start thinking about solutions once we got the carbon question closed,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much was from aviation, or automobiles, or industry?\u201d For dark plastic, the leading hypothesis has been that the majority of it sinks to the seafloor. Much of it might degrade quickly into microplastic and then sink; other pieces might sink and then quickly degrade, becoming part of that sedimentary record.\n\n- Scientists working for the nonprofit Dutch organization the Ocean Cleanup, which is attempting to create a giant autonomous rake to collect and remove trash floating on the high seas, published a study in the journal Scientific Reports last week that presents a new hypothesis. Based on data the group has collected in the field, it posits that only a small fraction of the plastic that has entered the ocean eventually arrives to one of the five great ocean gyres, where it might persist for decades. According to the study, most of the plastic thought to be currently in the marine environment\u2014somewhere between seventy and a hundred and eighty-nine million metric tons\u2014is stranded, lingering on shorelines and beaches, or buried near the coastline, deep under sand and rocks.\n\n- On various Ocean Cleanup expeditions across the Pacific, researchers had collected a good deal of decades-old trash from the surface. The age of the items was apparent because of their displayed production dates. The oldest item discovered was a plastic bottle crate from 1977. But, apart from debris resulting from the tsunami in Japan in 2011, researchers did not find much recently made plastic\u2014items from the past decade, during which plastic production, and the resulting emissions, have been at their fastest and greatest rates. This was perplexing; if it was true that most plastic sinks and degrades, as the leading hypothesis put forth, then, statistically speaking, most of the plastic that the researchers found floating at the surface should be newer.\n\n- Lebreton created what he describes as a very simple computer box model, which relies on five parameters, including the coastal stranding rate and plastic\u2019s degradation rate, to better understand how different types of plastic move in the sea and why so much of the plastic they have found is so old. Lebreton and his co-authors, Matthias Egger and Boyan Slat, the founder of the Ocean Cleanup, wrote that, based on the model, it seems that land is likely \u201cstoring a major fraction of the missing plastic debris.\u201d A small fraction of the plastic is \u201cpossibly slowly circulating between coastal environments with repeated episodes of beaching, fouling\u201d\u2014the accumulation of living and nonliving things on the materials\u2019 surface\u2014\u201cdefouling and resurfacing.\u201d The older artifacts that the researchers had seen in the middle of the ocean were the few that had escaped the cycle, at least for a while. If they had not collected them, those artifacts might have also, one day, washed up again, on yet another beach.\n\n- Van Sebille, who was not involved in Lebreton\u2019s study and has not worked for the Ocean Cleanup, applauded the study and the simplicity of Lebreton\u2019s model, which made it easy and quick to use. \u201cThese kind of exploratory models are desperately needed in the field,\u201d he said. His project, topios, is still a few years away from any definite conclusions. But, van Sebille said, the findings in Lebreton\u2019s paper\u2014that most of the missing plastic has landed near the shore\u2014\u201cis kind of what we are seeing in our models, too.\u201d If Lebreton\u2019s conclusion \u201cis true, then that is very problematic,\u201d he continued. Most marine life is near coastlines\u2014fisheries, agriculture, coral reefs. \u201cIn the open ocean, sure there are organisms, but the biodiversity and economic value of that is far lower.\u201d",
  "summary": "The discussion about the impact of plastic waste on the environment is concerning and thought-provoking. The article sheds light on the widespread distribution and potential harm of microplastics, emphasizing the urgent need for solutions to this issue. The findings underscore the complex nature of plastic pollution and its implications for marine ecosystems. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
