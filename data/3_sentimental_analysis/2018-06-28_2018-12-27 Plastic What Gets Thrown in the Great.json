  "readable_content": "-User (2023-12-08): Skip to main content\n  --COMMENT--\n  I will skip the irrelevant information.\n-User (2023-12-08): Plastic: What Gets Thrown in the Great Lakes, Stays in the Great Lakes\nThe world\u2019s largest freshwater ecosystem is awash in plastic. Bags and bottle caps litter beaches. Tiny plastic fibers ride the waves. Small, broken-down pellets swirl close to shore. Microscopic plastic bits drift throughout all five Great Lakes and are turning up in drinking water, locally brewed beer, and the stomachs of wildlife. In short, plastic is everywhere.\n\nIn the nascent scientific field of plastic pollution, researchers are looking into how much plastic is already in the lakes, where it comes from, and how it might affect the ecosystem. The hope is that the more we know about the plastic flowing into the Great Lakes, the more we can do to curb it.\n\nManufacturers are currently generating more single-use plastic than ever before, with half of the world\u2019s plastic hitting the market within the past 13 years. And globally, we recycle just 9 percent of it. Most (at least 60 percent) winds up in landfills or the environment\u2014and up to 10,000 metric tons of plastic enters the Great Lakes every year.\n\n-ADVERTISEMENT REMOVED-\n\nUnlike ocean plastics, which can get caught up in currents and circulate around the globe, the material swirling in the Great Lakes has nowhere to go. It usually comes from nearby sources, such as sewer pipes carrying refuse that\u2019s been washed into street drains, washing machines that send microfibers into city treatment systems, and windblown litter from beachgoers or lakeside neighborhoods. The larger plastic chunks break down into microplastics and tend to concentrate on the shores closest to big cities like Cleveland and Chicago.\n\nTim Hoellein, an aquatic ecologist who studies the lakes\u2019 plastic pollution at Loyola University Chicago, has found microplastics and microfibers in the guts of 94 percent of the fish he has sampled. He and others are looking into how those plastics might affect fish and human health, but they don\u2019t have any clear answers yet. What we do know is that these tiny plastics seem to travel through a fish\u2019s digestive tract within two days (one of Hoellein\u2019s grad students is studying this), but plastic pieces almost always get stuck somewhere in the fish\u2019s body along the way. Another Hoellein discovery is that in riverine environments, microplastics appear to function like other small particles (think sand) and can look like fish food for decades.\n\n\u201cIn one way or another, plastic becomes part of the ecosystem,\u201d says Hoellein. \u201cIt\u2019s not going away. It sticks around.\u201d Plastic is, after all, designed for durability.\n\nThe decision of how to deal with this insidious problem is necessarily a local one. No national standard or mandate for how to treat or recycle plastic currently exists, so each state and city handle it differently. Here are some ways citizens and lawmakers in the Great Lakes region (and anywhere) can help tackle plastic at its source: us.\n\n-ADVERTISEMENT REMOVED-\n\nRecycle\nRecycling rates in the states surrounding the Great Lakes are just OK. Minnesotans are doing the best job in the region, recycling approximately 38 percent of their waste. Michiganders, on the other hand, have one of the lowest recycling rates in the country, putting just 15 percent of their waste in the recycling bin. Michigan governor Rick Snyder created an advisory panel last year to come up with ways to increase the state\u2019s abysmal recycling rate.\n-ADVERTISEMENT REMOVED-\n\nReduce\nRecycling rates aside, ultimately we have to slow our plastic consumption, and the resulting pollution stream, to a trickle. That\u2019s something Chicago\u2019s Shedd Aquarium is pushing for. Reducing plastic pollution is one of its main initiatives now, says Andrea Densham, senior director of conservation policy and advocacy. The aquarium sponsors beach cleanups, replaced all the plastic straws in its caf\u00e9s with paper ones, got more than 125 restaurants and other establishments to offer plastic straws only on request, and asked people to #SheddtheStraw and share their experiences on social media. Restaurants in Milwaukee, Indianapolis, and other cities are kicking the straw habit too.",
  "summary": "The conversation about banning plastic straws is focused on taking action to reduce plastic pollution. There is a call to slow down plastic consumption and decrease the pollution stream. Organizations like the Shedd Aquarium are leading initiatives to reduce plastic waste, such as replacing plastic straws with paper ones and encouraging restaurants to offer plastic straws only upon request. This reflects a positive sentiment towards environmental conservation and taking proactive measures to address the issue of plastic pollution. \n\nSentiment: 0.9",
