  "readable_content": "- just_commenting (2014-12-08): Yes, but it's probably not going to do a lot of damage in this case. WD-40 is a proprietary mixture, but is known to include a bunch of aliphatic hydrocarbons, including naphtha. The body of the controller is probably made of ABS or polypropylene. Both of these (as well as many other plastics) are derived from petroleum products. It's not too surprising that many plastics exhibit sensitivity to petroleum products. It looks like ABS and PP are mostly stable with regards to naphtha - that is, you'd have to keep the plastic exposed to naphtha for a long time, preferably at a high temperature, before you'd see a significant change. However, I'd suggest a) wiping the surface down with a damp cloth afterwards, and b) avoiding the softer rubbery plastics that may be covering a joystick - these are generally going to be more sensitive.",
