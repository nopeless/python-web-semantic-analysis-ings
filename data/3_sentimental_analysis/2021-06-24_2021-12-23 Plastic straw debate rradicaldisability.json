The amount of times people say \"drink from the cup like an adult\" or \"you're not a toddler you don't need a straw\" is absolutely ridiculous. The constant implication that anybody who has mobility issues isn't an adult is really upsetting and honestly it just hurts to constantly see it. Abled people also don't seem to realize the vast amount of reasons people need straws. Some people just have sensitive teeth and need a straw! Comparing anybody that needs a straw to an infant/child is super shitty and I'm just so tired of explaining that to people.\n\n- LadyAlekto (2021-12-08): My favourite is when they then claim to just use reusable. And i wonder how tf i should get the energy to also clean these properly on top of everything else\n\n  - auggie235 (2021-12-08): It seems like whenever I say that none of the alternatives work for me people tend to immediately suggest an alternative that I\u2019ve already tried\n\n    - InfinitePoints (2021-12-08): The pollution from straws are very insignificant. Choosing a vegan meal once probably offsets all the pollution created in a years worth of straw usage. Also, reusable straws aren't necessarily more environmentally friendly unless used a lot: [link]\n\n      - auggie235 (2021-12-08): Exactly! I live a pretty low waste lifestyle and I\u2019m vegetarian. It\u2019s so hurtful when people assume I don\u2019t care about the environment because I use plastic straws. I had a period of time during the onset of my disability where I refused to use plastic straws and I got injured, had allergic reactions, and got dehydrated. For a while I needed IV fluids which is a whole lot more waste than a plastic straw\n\n        - witchofthewind (2021-12-08): Choosing a vegan meal once probably offsets all the pollution created in a years worth of straw usage. that really depends a lot on the time of year and where you live. where I live, certain vegan meals (ones that use mostly local produce) are ok for about 1/3 of the year, but otherwise vegan meals are responsible for a lot more pollution per meal than non-vegan meals using locally farmed meat, eggs, and milk.\n\n          - earthtwobrian (2021-12-08): I agree with you. I\u2019m a PA for an amazing gent, and straws are necessary. He has an array of them that work well at home, but I need to get better about bringing them out with us though. I wish restaurants would start providing washable ones like any other utensil. I see it in a similar light to shopping bags. I really do hate the plastic",
