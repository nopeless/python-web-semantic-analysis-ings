  "body": "Residue out of plastic straw? So I am relatively new to smoking fent, and I have a plastic straw made from a hollowed out pen. there's a bunch of residue built up on the end but I don't know if there's a way to get that out or smoke it without burning off plastic as well.",
  "readable_content": "- whoistyler420 (2020-12-08): Residue out of plastic straw?\n  Just scrape the inside with a paper clip or bobby pin... Or what I do to my pen\" straws\"... Is just cut the pen in half long ways into 2 pieces and scrape it out with a knife... But if you do that scrape it first as much as you can with a bobby pin or paper clip before you cut it open so you don't lose any of the residue inside.\n- LurkerMurker7 (2020-12-08): Roll up a foil tooter and smoke it off itself when your done.\n- Trapsmack (2020-12-08): Go to a meeting.\n- shojohn8ton (2020-12-08): Unfurl a paper clip.\n- KAdeleK87 (2020-12-08): Bend a Bobby pin and scrape the pen.\n- garygtheg (2020-12-08): Just take a toothpick or something and push it all out. That's what I do.",
