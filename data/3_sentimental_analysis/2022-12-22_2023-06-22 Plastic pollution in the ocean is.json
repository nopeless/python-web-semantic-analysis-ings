  "readable_content": "- Washington Post (2023-12-08): The trillions of plastic particles in the oceans, doubling every six years, weigh roughly 2.4 million metric tons and equate to over 170 trillion pieces of plastic. Only 10% of plastic ever made has been recycled, and the plastic pollution issue has reached unprecedented levels. The study draws on nearly 12,000 samples collected over 40 years, and research into plastics pollution has shifted to rivers and other waterways as advocates seek to understand the issue at its origin. The study may provide momentum to U.N. talks to reduce global plastics pollution.",
