  "readable_content": "- NPR (2023-12-08): The U.S. Interior Department plans to phase out single-use plastics in national parks and facilities by 2032. They aim to find alternative materials and reduce the impact of plastic waste on ecosystems and climate. This initiative is part of President Joe Biden's executive order to establish the federal government as a leader in sustainability. The move responds to the harmful effects of plastic pollution in oceans, with the U.S. producing over 300 million tons of plastic annually, and 14 million of them ending up in the ocean. Less than 10% of plastics are recycled, with rates of recycling not increasing in recent years. The Interior Department's commitment also aligns with efforts to address plastic pollution's threats to food safety, human health, coastal tourism, and climate change.",
