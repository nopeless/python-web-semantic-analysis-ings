  "body": "To be fair, plastic straws were never one of the main problems with plastic -- it's mostly industrial/commercial uses by the large corporations as well as fishing nets. I think if there was a durable plastic straw (made of thick plastic) you could just keep reusing it instead of throwing it away all the time. Or, conversely, drink out of a cup.",

I have very weak enamel and my teeth feel like sandpaper after something like orange juice so I always use a straw and it helps tremendously, even my dentist agrees.\n    - [deleted] (2021-08-09): I have sensitive teeth and ice water hurts to sip. And if I\u2019m driving, I don\u2019t want to be handling a cup without a lid and potentially spilling it.\n    - solvsamorvincet (2021-08-09): Welcome to individualist capitalism, where everything is the individual's fault.\n    - damageinc86 (2021-08-09): Yet almost everything else companies manufacture and wrap stuff in is plastic. This straw thing is just a virtue signal. Most car bumpers are plastic and Styrofoam, nobody's complaining about that.\n    - smallmanchat (2021-08-09): Plastic Straws account for like 1% of the plastic in our oceans. There\u2019s far bigger problems we have to deal with then eliminating plastic straws with far inferior products\n    - _Scipio__Africanus_ (2021-08-09): Plastic straws count for nowhere near that amount. It's 0.025%\n    - aFiachra (2021-08-09): I love that this is the line in the sand. Suddenly it is up to ME to figure out how to curtail plastics. I\u2019ve been recycling for 30 years and found out my city dumps most of my plastic into landfills because it is too expensive to do the right thing. But I am the asshole for using a straw. Fuck virtue signaling.\n    - Diofernic (2021-08-09): I don't understand what you are complaining about. Straws are often provided without the customer's input, whether they need one or don't. Most of the time you really don't need a straw, so making it a conscious decision to take one will probably reduce the amount people use, without adding the inconvenience of not having straws at all or only having paper straws.\n- r/babyelephantgifs (2021-08-09): Humdrum day on the savanna\n- r/NoStupidQuestions (2021-08-09): Why are companies using paper straws?\n- r/Piracy (2021-08-09): Sony Steals Customers' Purchased Content - Piracy is COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED | Louis Rossmann Youtube\n- r/nonononoyes (2021-08-09): Clever teenage girl eluding a creepy guy pursuing her in a car\n- r/ShingekiNoKyojin (2021-08-09): My attempt at The Eren Fallen Angel picture\n- r/LinusTechTips (2021-08-09): Linus Tech Tips - Let\u2019s See If I Can Get Fired - AMD $5,000 Ultimate Tech Upgrade November 16, 2023 at 03:57PM\n- r/Showerthoughts (2021-08-09): Paper straws are great for the environment and ineffective at being straws.\n- r/NoStupidQuestions (2021-08-09): Straws are paper but lids are still plastic?\n- r/unpopularopinion (2021-08-09): Removing the plastic straw doesn't fix anything if there's literally 5 more things that are made of plastic\n- r/E30 (2021-08-09): Although its a 7 Series but the difference in grill design and size is so crazy nowadays!\n- r/AmazonDSPDrivers (2021-08-09): Vlogger fired from Amazon after documenting a week as an Amazon delivery driver\n- r/LinusTechTips (2021-08-09): New LTT dropped: He told me it was indestructible.
