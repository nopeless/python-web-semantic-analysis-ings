  "readable_content": "BBCNews (2023-12-08): Scientists have discovered that sea turtles mistake the scent of plastic for food, making them prone to eating and getting entangled in plastic debris. This \"olfactory trap\" is a result of plastic giving off similar odors to the turtles' natural food sources. The accumulation of plastic in the oceans poses a threat to marine species, including endangered turtles, birds, and whales. Researchers found that sea turtles are attracted to plastic due to the food-like odors created as microbes and tiny animals colonize the plastic. The study, involving young loggerhead sea turtles, highlights the need for research to protect marine animals threatened by plastic debris. It's predicted that given current trends, 99% of seabirds will have ingested plastic waste by 2050.\n\n- This information sheds light on an important issue affecting marine life and emphasizes the urgency of finding solutions to reduce plastic pollution in our oceans.",
