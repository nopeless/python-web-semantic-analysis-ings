  "readable_content": "- esporx (2023-12-08): Plastic recycling a \"failed concept,\" study says, with only 5% recycled in U.S. last year as production rises\n  - With hindsight, it was a feelgood program for consumers, but absolved the plastics industry of obligations to actually make it work. Single use plastic must be legislated into either a working recycling system, or banned from nonessential uses.\n- Royal_Aioli914 (2023-12-08): Yeah. Unfortunately, I do think much of the motivation was in just making consumer goods more appealing and less guilt inducing. This resulted in just more adoption of plastics, and less competitive ability to offer an alternative that was not wrapped in plastic.\n- jpegjpg (2023-12-08): Surprise! did you know that we were going to ban single use due to garbage issues but the plastic industry lobbied law makers to push the burden on consumers and say they should be recycling rather then they should not be manufacturing garbage.\n- TheMostDoomed (2023-12-08): The concept of plastic recycling was sold to us all by the oil and plastic companies.\n- First_Safety1328 (2023-12-08): It is possible but will ultimately require a recycling facility that is akin to an oil refinery for plastics, and the technology is not at the point where it is cost effective (at this moment). \n   - Doesn't mean it can't get there. I work in plastics industry, and I also believe there will need to be a massive shift in what the public perceives as acceptable in their views of plastic packaging. Polymers degrade and shift to a yellowish color each time they are recycled, and this is a massive challenge to maintain a crystal clear product that the consumer expects...\n- BlackSquirrel05 (2023-12-08): \"Oh yeah you can totes recycle most plastic.\"\n  - Going down as one of the larger lies told to us in the modern era. (or things just muttered under some people's breath.)\n- DJ_Femme-Tilt (2023-12-08): Side note we all did a really poor job of paying attention to the \"reduce --> reuse--> recycle\" part of that chain.\n  - one thing they neglected to stress with this was that each of those is worth an order of magnitude more than the next. \n   - In school, when the program was still fresh, they were held up each basically as an equal, and then would GUSH about the glory of recycling. All the while, reuse is an order of magnitude more effective than recycling, and REDUCE is vastly superior to them both.\n- CIA_Linguist (2023-12-08): This past year I have found that when writing articles on this topic, it is best to compare the percentage of the leading countries compared to the United States, specifically in the title...\n- scribbyshollow (2023-12-08): so are we going to make the producers of this garbage have to change or are we just going to \"oh well\" the situation?\n- MacNuggetts (2023-12-08): Finally. Can we stop putting the onus on individual people to save the planet, and start tackling the problem at the source?\n- NoFunHere (2023-12-08): One major issue is the article itself, which focuses way too much on the USA where the overwhelming majority of plastic that isn't recycled is safely discarded in landfills...\n  - The much, much more acute problem is the entire developing world that throws their plastic on the ground or, if it is actually collected as trash, is dumped into rivers...\n- jsebrech (2023-12-08): \u2026 in the U.S.\n  - Meanwhile in Europe some countries exceed 50% plastic recycling rate.\n- patman3030 (2023-12-08): 5% of everything is still a hell of a lot of plastic. Each milk container or tupperware bin that gets mulched to make new plastic is one that doesn't end up strangling an endangered animal or clogging up a waterway.\n- Royal_Aioli914 (2023-12-08): I think if you really dig into it, you would find that headlines like these serve to inform people how ludicrously inefficient the current state of recycling is...\n  - There are people innovating in this space as well. The fact of the matter is that plast \n\n--- \nThe conversation continues, but the rest of the text was not available.",
  "summary": "The conversation reflects a strong sentiment that the current state of plastic recycling in the U.S. is inefficient and ineffective. There is a widespread belief that the plastics industry should take more responsibility for the issue, rather than placing the burden on consumers. Some also emphasize the need for a shift in public perception and behavior regarding plastic usage. Overall, the sentiment leans towards the need for larger systemic changes rather than individual consumer actions.\n\nSentiment: 0.7",
