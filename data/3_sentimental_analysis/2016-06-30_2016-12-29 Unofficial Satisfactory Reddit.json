The belt with more ingots is mk 1, so it has more time to load it up. Time to fall on my sword. I do wish the belt design between Mk 1 and 2 were a little easier to distinguish though.\n    ![Image](https://preview.redd.it/steel-ingot-production-slower-on-one-constructor-than-v0-mcs0zp86qd5c1.png?width=2521&format=png&auto=webp&s=979a5f8c3a5fe1303358c2bef241ab1fb482afc5)\n- u/CollisionCourse78 (2021-12-08): I mixed regular coal with compacted coal in my miles long conveyor system.
