  "readable_content": "-User (2023-12-08): When you think of plastic pollution, you may think of plastic bags strangling sea animals or bottles littering the landscape. But the impacts of plastic pollution go far beyond the finished product and start with how plastics are made. The plastics industry is actually the fastest-growing source of industrial greenhouse gases in the world. The UN Environment Programme estimates that the greenhouse gas emissions from plastic production, use, and disposal could account for 19 percent of the total global carbon budget by 2040. \n\nPlastics are not one distinct material but rather a group of materials with different compositions and characteristics. About 99 percent of the plastics we use today originate from fossil fuels like oil, gas, or coal. Scientists estimate that between 1950 and 2017, the world produced 9.2 billion tons of plastic. Today, we manufacture around 438 million tons of new plastic every year, with no slowdown in sight.\n\nOf all the plastic waste we generate globally, scientists estimate that less than 10 percent is recycled. The rest ends up in landfills, nature, or is incinerated. Plastics result in greenhouse gas emissions at every stage of their lifecycle \u2013 from the extraction and transport of fossil fuels to energy- and emissions-intensive refining processes to plastic waste management or leakage into the environment. Plastic can seriously harm ecosystems when leaking into the environment, impacting animals and causing chemical or biological harm.\n\nTo mitigate the climate, environmental, and health impacts of plastic pollution, efforts must focus on cutting down overall production, ending the production and consumption of single-use plastics, reducing the use of inessential plastics packaging, championing the transition to zero-waste communities, and enforcing extended producer responsibility. Individual actions such as bringing your own bottles, choosing items with less packaging, and supporting sustainable local alternatives can also make a difference.\n\nAt the fifth UN Environment Assembly, 175 nations agreed to begin negotiations on a legally binding UN treaty on plastic pollution that addresses the full lifecycle of plastic. These negotiations are set to start in November 2022 and wrap up in 2024.",
