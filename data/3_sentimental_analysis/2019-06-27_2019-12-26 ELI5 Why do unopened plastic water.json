  "readable_content": "- mcmenrm (2019-12-08): \nELI5: Why do unopened plastic water bottles do that \u201csquishy\u201d thing?\nI really hope someone knows what I\u2019m talking about, as it\u2019s extremely hard to explain without visual aid.\n\n- sillystringmassacre (2019-12-08): \nI\u2019ve always assumed it was just a thinner type of plastic. But interested to hear from someone who actually knows lol\n\n- oopleeaze (2019-12-08): \nI got one of those last week. I think it is because it got squished somehow just as the lid was put on. When I opened it, it had less water than the other bottles. Same thing though, plastic returned to original strength.\n\n- yadayadatennessee (2019-12-08): \nLike when you try to open it it just squishes?\n\n- ahmadove (2019-12-08): \nI think you're referring to a phenomenon called panel sink. There are multiple reasons for it:\n... (detailed explanation)\n\n- Commander-Grammar (2019-12-08): \nIt\u2019s either pressure or temperature change. If it\u2019s bottled at a higher altitude it will compress a little bit as it\u2019s shipped to you. When you open it, the slight vacuum is relieved and the bottle appears to get stronger as it returns to its intended shape. Same thing would happen with a temperature change. Look up pictures of potato chip bags at high altitude. It\u2019s the opposite of that.",
