The government has since said it thinks this figure is wrong.\n\nSee the action taken as a result of this fact check.\n 1 of 2 claims\n\n-\u201cIn England, it is estimated we use 8.5\u00a0billion plastic straws\u2026 a year,\u00a0according to government figures.\u201d\n\n-Independent, 22 May 2019\n\n-\u201c\u2026 nearly 5bn plastic straws [are] currently used each year in the UK\u2026\u201d\n\n-The Guardian, 22 May 2019\n\n-\u201cDefra said that 4.7 billion plastic straws\u2026 were used each year in England.\u201d\n\n-The Times, 22 May 2019\n\nLast week the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) announced an almost total ban on the supply of plastic straws, drink stirrers and cotton buds will come into force next year. Following this a number of news outlets reported figures on how many of these items we use in the UK each year.\n\n-But there were differences in the way some outlets reported the number of plastic straws we use each year. The Independent provided different numbers to\u00a0many of\u00a0the other news outlets and the Guardian incorrectly reported that the figures were for the whole of the UK rather than England.\n\n-(Since we originally published this article, both the Guardian and the Independent have corrected their figures).\n\n-A poll published on Twitter by the Prime Minister\u2019s office also incorrectly attributed the 4.7 billion figure to the whole of the UK.\n\n-This 4.7 billion figure, which was quoted by most media outlets, seems to originate from the original Defra press release announcing the ban, and appears to be based on the findings of a report prepared for Defra last year.\n\n-Any figures on the number of straws used each year across the UK or England are based on estimates and carry a high degree of uncertainty.\n\nHonesty in public debate matters",
