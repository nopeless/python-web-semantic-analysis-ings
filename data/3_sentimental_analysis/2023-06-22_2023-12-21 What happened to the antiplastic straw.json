  "body": "The anti-plastic straw movement was a success story in 2015, when plastic straws were the trendy rallying cry for sustainability. But the movement also faced challenges and criticisms, such as the fact that plastic straws are a small part of the single-use plastic problem, the lack of recycling, and the impact on people with disabilities.

Yes, but not in the way you\u2019d think.\n\nPlastic straws used to be \u201cenvironment enemy number one.\u201d\n\nBY HARVIN BHATHAL/GRIST | PUBLISHED AUG 4, 2023 8:50 AM EDT\n\nENVIRONMENT\nPaper straws get soggy and fall apart more quickly, reusable straws made of metal are not easy to bend, and silicone straws are difficult to clean. Getty Images.\nSHARE    \n\nThis story was\u00a0co-published\u00a0with\u00a0Grist,\u00a0a nonprofit media organization covering climate, justice, and solutions.\n\nIt was the face that launched a thousand plastic straw bans.\u00a0\n\nThe video begins with a close up of the turtle\u2019s head, its dark green, pebbled skin out of place against the stark-white boat deck. Robinson\u2019s hands approach, moving the pliers toward the turtle\u2019s nostril. The tool clamps down on the edge of something\u2014A barnacle? A worm?\u2014barely visible within the dark tunnel. The creature squirms and dribbles blood as the pulling begins. A long, thin object begins to emerge, inch by excruciating inch.\n\nIt was August 10, 2015, and marine conservation biologist Christine Figgener was collecting data for her Ph.D. a few miles off the coast of Guanacaste, Costa Rica. She and a colleague, Nathan Robinson, were researching olive ridley sea turtles when they noticed a male had something encrusted in its nose. The pair decided to try to extract the object. Robinson flipped open his Swiss army knife\u2019s pliers and Figgener grabbed her phone and began to film.\u00a0\n\n\u201cWe had no idea what we were frigging looking at,\u201d Figgener said in a newer, annotated version of the video. It wasn\u2019t until one of the researchers cut off a piece of the object that they realized what it was: a four-inch piece of plastic straw.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t believe that such a mundane object that we really use on a daily basis \u2026 that we found it in the turtle\u2019s nose,\u201d she said\u2014\u201cthat a tiny object caused so much suffering.\u201d\n\nWhen Figgener uploaded the turtle straw video to her YouTube account eight years ago, it went viral. For a few years, plastic straws were the trendy rallying cry for sustainability. In many ways, the campaign was a success story \u2014 one that elevated our awareness of single-use plastics to the point where it resulted in actual policy change. But upon reflection, not all the solutions that spun out of the anti-straw movement actually held water. In recent years, many environmental pundits have focused on the movement\u2019s shortcomings.\u00a0\n\nTo many environmentalists fighting plastic pollution, anti-straw advocacy now feels pass\u00e9\u2014out of touch with the broader need to address all forms of single-use plastic. But the movement\u2019s rise and fall still holds lessons for the activists of today.\u00a0\n\nFrom soda bottles to yogurt containers, there is a lot of plastic pollution out there. So how did we end up so obsessed with straws?\n\nThe anti-plastic straw movement didn\u2019t actually originate with Figgener\u2019s turtle video. Back in 2011, a 9-year-old named Milo Cress found it odd that the restaurants he would go to with his mom in Burlington, Vermont, would automatically serve drinks with a straw, whether or not their customer wanted one. He approached the owner of Leunig\u2019s Bistro and Caf\u00e9 in Burlington, and eventually, Leunig\u2019s became one of the first establishments in the country to ask customers whether they wanted a straw or not.\n\nEventually, Cress and his mom made some calls to straw manufacturers and estimated that 500 million straws are used and discarded by people in the U.S. every day. The environmental advocacy group Eco-Cycle published Cress\u2019s findings, which in the years since have been cited by nearly every major news media outlet that has covered the plastic straw beat, including CNN, the New York Times, and the Washington Post. (The credibility of that figure has since been questioned, with market research firms determining the figure to be between 170 million and 390 million a day.)\n\nBut the turtle video added just the right amount of injury to plastic insult. Figgener\u2019s viral footage helped stir single-use plastic outrage into a frenzy. Celebrities called on their followers to #stopsucking, a social media campaign that aimed to \u201cturn the plastic straw into environment enemy number one.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThousands of restaurants joined the pledge and the idea took off, reaching the rare environmental threshold of actual policy change. In 2018, Seattle became the first big city in the United States to ban plastic straws. It was followed shortly by other major municipalities in California, New Jersey, Florida, and other states. That same year, companies including Starbucks and American Airlines jumped on the anti-straw bandwagon, the former announcing it would launch a new \u201csippy\u201d lid for its cold beverages starting in 2020, allegedly diverting more than 1 billion straws per year.\n\nBut for all its success in getting people riled up about plastic pollution, much of that outrage seemed limited to, well, straws, which only make up a small part of the single-use problem. National Geographic calculated that of the 8 million tons of plastic deposited into the world\u2019s oceans each year, only 0.025 percent is comprised of plastic straws.\u00a0\n\nSome anti-plastic advocates began denouncing the straw bans as \u201cslacktivism,\u201d a type of activism characterized by a lack of commitment or effort. They said the bans gave people an overblown sense that they were making a difference in combating the plastics crisis. For example, anti-straw pledges didn\u2019t seem as concerned with other types of plastic waste or the fossil fuels associated with every part of their life cycle. Even the anti-straw Starbucks sippy lids were actually made from polypropylene, a type of plastic that has a 3 percent recycling rate in the U.S. (The company claimed it was still an improvement, as the new lids could potentially be recycled. Plastic straws are too lightweight and thin to make it through the mechanical recycling sorting process.)\n\nThe anti-plastic straw movement also started getting pushback from disability advocates, who pointed out that some people need flexible straws to be able to drink liquids. Paper straws get soggy and fall apart more quickly, reusable straws made of metal are not easy to bend, and silicone straws are difficult to clean.\n\nFor the average consumer, functionality is often more important than sustainability, said Leslie Davenport, a climate psychology educator and consultant. \u201cOur brains favor habits because they conserve energy. So if we are going against the current\u2014a BYO straw for example\u2014it\u2019s hard for most people to do so unless highly motivated.\u201d\u00a0\n\nFor restaurants that chose to continue to provide disposable straws, there were options beyond paper or plastic. Straws made with natural materials such as sugarcane and wheat are 100 percent biodegradable, but are inflexible and cost more to manufacture. As a result, many businesses looked to straws made from bioplastics \u2014 allegedly compostable plastics made from corn, sugarcane, agave, and other nonpetroleum sources. But according to Brandon Leeds, co-founder of SOFi Paper Products, bioplastics require specific disposal and processing methods, many of which aren\u2019t always followed or clearly outlined, in order for them to decompose effectively.\u00a0\n\n\u201cMany businesses desire to adopt sustainable practices, and when they encounter these plastic-like alternatives, they may mistakenly believe that they can be environmentally conscious without truly moving away from the plastic aesthetic,\u201d Leeds said. \u201cThe absence of stricter governmental regulations allows companies to take advantage of greenwashing tactics, making it difficult to differentiate genuinely sustainable options from those that are not.\u201d\n\nBuying into greenwashing, a term that refers to environmental \u201csolutions\u201d whose appeal is based on appearing environmentally friendly rather t",
  "summary": "The post discusses the mixed outcomes of the plastic straw bans, highlighting the unintended consequences and limitations of the movement. It emphasizes the need for a broader approach to addressing single-use plastics and the complexities involved in finding sustainable alternatives. The sentiment is balanced and critical, acknowledging both the success and the limitations of the anti-straw movement. \nSentiment: 0.5",
