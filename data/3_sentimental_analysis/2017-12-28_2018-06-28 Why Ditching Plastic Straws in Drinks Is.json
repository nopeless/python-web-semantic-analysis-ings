You\u2019ve probably seen the stories about municipalities (including New York City) and companies (like McDonald\u2019s) addressing the issue. Starting July 1, Seattle becomes one of the first cities in the U.S. to ban plastic straws and utensils commonly handed out at restaurants.\n\nBut did you know the hospitality industry has been tackling the issue head-on over the past few years? Despite the fact straws seems like a drop in the ocean compared with other waste \u2014 our rampant burning of fossil fuels, deforestation of the Amazon, and pumping of CO2 into the atmosphere \u2014 attacking sippers is not a straw man argument (pun intended). It\u2019s a small piece of the puzzle that, now we\u2019re at a tipping point (or is it a sipping point?), can and will lead to an extensive re-examination of our relationship with plastic.",
