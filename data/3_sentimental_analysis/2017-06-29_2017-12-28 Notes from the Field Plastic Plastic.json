I will take your suggestion and see if I can raise awareness through more wide-ranging exposure of the photo. Regards, Eric\n\nEric Lindstrom (2017-10-30): \n- Dear MMJarrell,\n  Last year\u2019s SPURS-2 mascot was \u201cMonkey\u201d \u2013 who is home with his young owner this year. We have Ootori-sama aboard thanks to David Ho from the University of Hawaii. Ootori-sama may be overtaken in popularity by our two (very cute) Egrets who have adopted the ship. After a couple of days aboard, they have lost fear of us and walk around the deck like part of the science party. Best, Eric",
