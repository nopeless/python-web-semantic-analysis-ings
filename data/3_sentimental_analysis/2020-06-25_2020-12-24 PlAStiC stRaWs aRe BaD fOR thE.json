She thinks using a Keep Cup means that she gets to bring a child into the world, raise it on a omnivorous borderline carnivorous diet, use disposable nappies and judge everyone else for drinking out of disposable coffee cups (not that I do, but she looks down her nose at others who do).\n  I pointed out her hypocrisy once and she almost cried (literally).\n- grimreefer702 (2020-12-08):\n  - That's a straight disgusting human that never had an introspection view of her life. Always lives life like others tell her, reflection how she sees her surroundings.\n- trvekvltmaster (2020-12-08):\n  - Yes, 47% of ocean trash is from fishing, but it\u2019s the straws.\n- submat87 (2020-12-08):\n  - Same goes for people who eat sea animals while 46% plastic in Ocean is from fishing industry aka abandoned fishing gears and nets.\n- AntinatalismFTW (2020-12-08):\n  - Breeders can't be environmentalists lol. I can drive a fleet of untuned Hummers every day, never recycle, etc for the rest of my life and not harm the environment nearly as much as a person with one kid.\n- Candi88 (2020-12-08):\n  - Lol right. My boss recently made a comment about me drinking plastic water bottles (which I rarely do). I thought that\u2019s ironic considering he has 4 children\n- mikaxu987 (2020-12-08):\n  - Same! I lived in Athens, Greece for six months and even thought the water was drinkable, it was disgusting, so I bought plastic water bottles instead. My mom came to visit me and berated me for participating to the plastic waste. Then I reminded her that she has been using coffee capsule every day for the last 15 years or so. She got silent and never brought it up again lol. I didn\u2019t and I am still harassing her to stop participating to plastic waste.\n- weddle_seal (2020-12-08):\n  - lower population =less demand for goods =less resources needed =less harm to envoriment /more time for resources like tree to grow back. if there is only 1 million people in the world we can all drive tanks and it will still be ok\n- strangersIknow (2020-12-08):\n  - Also people who are vegans for environmental reasons who have kids. Those get on my nerves the most, especially when they think their kids aren\u2019t gonna turn around and eat a burger as soon as they\u2019re old enough to consider rebellion or even just curiosity.\n- mikaxu987 (2020-12-08):\n  - Exactly. You never know how your kid is going to turn out. Ok you\u2019re raising them vegan but maybe they will want to try meat after leaving the nest, will end up becoming huge meat eaters and will then get children and raise them on a meat and dairy diet. You might have the best intentions as a parent but you can never be sure of the future, unless you don\u2019t have children. Then you\u2019re sure.",
