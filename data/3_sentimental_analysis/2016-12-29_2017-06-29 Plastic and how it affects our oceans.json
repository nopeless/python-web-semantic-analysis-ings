It's in your clothes, phone, car, mattress, and TV screen.\n\n\"Plastic can be flexible or rigid, and its lightness also makes it very appealing,\" said Professor Holmes.\n\nBut for all the benefits plastic has given us, disposing of products \u2014 particularly those designed to be used only once, such as packaging \u2014 has become a major environmental issue.\n\n\"The ocean is full of waste because humans have disposed of it carelessly,\" said Professor Holmes.\n\nSo how big is the problem, what happens once plastic goes into the ocean, and what can we do about it?\n\n- How much plastic goes into the ocean?\n- An estimated 8 million tonnes of plastic entered the ocean in 2010\n- Around 8 million tonnes of plastic went into the ocean in 2010, according to the most comprehensive study of plastic pollution so far.\n\nThe international study calculated that 192 nations produced a total of 275 million tonnes of plastic waste.\n\nThe largest amount of this waste was produced by China, at 1.32 to 3.52 million tonnes. This was followed by Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam.\n\nAustralia \u2014 which didn't rate in the top 20 polluters \u2014 contributed less than 0.01 million tonnes.\n\nBut that still added up to 13,888 tonnes of litter per year, a quarter of which finds its way into waterways, according to study co-author Dr Chris Wilcox of CSIRO's Oceans and Atmosphere Flagship.\n\n\n- With global production of plastic increasing exponentially, the amount of plastic finding its way into the ocean is likely to get much bigger.\n\n\"About every 11 years the amount of plastic produced doubles,\" said Dr Wilcox.\n\n\"To put that in other words, between now and 2028 we will produce as much plastic as we produced [from the 1950s] until now.\"\n\n- How long does plastic last in the ocean?\n- Plastics break down into small fragments in the ocean\n- Plastic is made to be strong and durable, so it can take a long time to break down.\n\n\"Plastics are very hard materials so they are hard to break down unless you can burn them,\" said Professor Holmes.\n\n\"There are some you can get back to original building blocks, but not many.\"\n\nThese include the newer plant-based bioplastics made out of polylactic acid (PLA). But much like traditional petrochemical plastics such as Perspex, PLA-based plastics only break down under very high temperatures.\n\n- What is plastic made from?\n- Plastics is the name we give to a group of substances mostly made from carbon-based molecules arranged in many repeat units (n) in a long chain known as a polymer.\nThere are many different types of plastics depending upon what is attached to the carbon\nPlastic shopping bags, for example, are made from a type of polymer called polyethylene (C2H4n) \u2014 where each unit in the chain is made up of two hydrogen atoms joined to one carbon atom.\nMost plastics are derived from petroleum, although some newer ones, known as bioplastics, are derived from building blocks produced by microbial fermentation or from corn syrup.\nChemicals including colourants, foaming agents, plasticisers, antioxidants and flame retardants can be added to different types of plastics to give them specific qualities such as colour, texture, flexibility and durability.\n\nIn the natural environment, the main things that break down plastics are sunlight, oxygen and water.\n\n- \"The problem is that normal degradation leaves particles that can still be harmful to living things \u2014 nanoparticles and microparticles,\" said Professor Holmes.\n\n\"Plastics should become more abundant as they break down in size, but recent research found the concentration of the smallest particles, between a few microns and a few millimetres, was much lower than expected.\"\n\n\"It's not clear what's going on \u2014 whether there's some kind of sampling problem, or if those things are settling to the bottom of the ocean,\" Dr Wilcox said.\n\nScientists have found evidence of microplastics in deep-sea sediments from the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean.\n\n- Plastic packaging and fishing gear are among the top items that find their way into the ocean",
