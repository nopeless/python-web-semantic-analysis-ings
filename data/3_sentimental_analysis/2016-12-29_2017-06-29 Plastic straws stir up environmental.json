  "readable_content": "-User (<datetime>): Skip to main content\n-User (<datetime>): SUBSCRIBE NOW\n-User (<datetime>): BAY AREA\n-User (<datetime>): Plastic straws stir up environmental debate in Berkeley\n-User (<datetime>): By Peter Fimrite\n-User (<datetime>): Updated June 2, 2017 7:34 p.m.\n-User (<datetime>): Thicker paper straws are used in milkshakes at Saturn Cafe in Berkeley, CA, on Friday June 2, 2017.\n-User (<datetime>): Michael Short/Special to the Chronicle\n-User (<datetime>): The plastic straw is a vital accoutrement for milk shakes and sodas and, to the dismay of schoolteachers, a formidable launcher of spit wads, but a growing number of Californians are challenging the virtue of this simple sucking device.\n-User (<datetime>): Conservation groups say far too many of the millions of plastic straws used and discarded in the United States every day are finding their way into the ocean and harming wildlife. The situation has prompted several California cities, including Berkeley, to consider banning the ubiquitous implements, part of a growing crusade to rid the world of plastic.\n-User (<datetime>): But the movement, which some call the \u201cStraw Wars,\u201d faces a significant challenge \u2014 and not just because it threatens the tradition of noisily slurping up the last bit of a shake. The biggest obstacle is that paper and other biodegradable straws, while reminding older folks of the collapse-prone straws of their childhood, can cost up to eight times more than the one-cent plastic versions.\n-User (<datetime>): The Berkeley City Council nevertheless dived headlong into the fight this week, directing staff to look into what would be the state\u2019s first ordinance prohibiting the use of plastic drinking straws in bars, restaurants and coffee shops.\n-User (<datetime>): The idea, pushed by the nonprofit Surfrider Foundation and other groups, is to remove a major source of pollution washing down storm drains and flowing into San Francisco Bay. The plastic straw and its cousin, the stirrer, represent the sixth most common type of litter found on California beaches during annual coastal cleanup days held since 1989, behind cigarette filters, food wrappers, lids, bags and plastic dining ware, according to the conservation group Save the Bay.\n-User (<datetime>): \u201cIt\u2019s a small item, but cumulatively straws have a huge impact on our environment,\u201d said Berkeley City Councilwoman Sophie Hahn, a co-author of the proposal to study a plastic straw ban. Citing an oft-quoted study, she said, \u201cA half-billion straws are used (each day in the U.S.) and many of them end up in our waterways. They are not biodegradable, and there are alternatives.\u201d\n-User (<datetime>): All of which may sound good, but the laws of business guide decisions, and plastic straws are still in demand, said Natalie Buketov, the founder and owner of Monster Straw Co. in Laguna Beach (Orange County).\n-User (<datetime>): \u201cRight now we have to go with what\u2019s cost-effective and what the public is actually buying,\u201d said Buketov, who has looked into a corn-based product similar to plastic. \u201cIf you can change the public\u2019s mind about what they are buying and what it costs, I\u2019m all in, but right now the public wants cheap plastic straws.\u201d\n-User (<datetime>): If approved, supporters say, straw bans would bolster the state\u2019s crackdown on single-use plastic grocery bags. Plastic litter makes up a large proportion of the estimated 1 million gallons of litter produced by Bay Area cities each year, said Martin Bourque, executive director of the nonprofit Ecology Center in Berkeley.\n-User (<datetime>): \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem we can recycle our way out of because single-use disposable plastic is hard to collect, expensive to process and doesn\u2019t have a specific market,\u201d said Bourque, who runs Berkeley\u2019s curbside recycling program. \u201cIt generally goes into Asian markets, where the things with the highest value are picked out and the rest is often dumped. That\u2019s how a straw from Starbucks in Berkeley might end up in the ocean near Bali.\u201d\n-User (<datetime>): The trash that flows out of urban storm drains is threatening the habitat of 500 species of wildlife, including 23 endangered species, in San Francisco Bay. Marine biologists say fish and birds often ingest pieces of plastic that they mistake for food.\n-User (<datetime>): \u201cPlastic straws and stirrers are big culprits in trashing San Francisco Bay and our oceans,\u201d said David Lewis, the executive director of Save the Bay.\n-User (<datetime>): Berkeley\u2019s Community Environmental Advisory Commission and Zero Waste Commission are expected to talk to business owners and others over the next few months about the feasibility of a plastic straw ban, while determining whether a compostable or reusable alternative, like paper or bamboo, can stand in.\n-User (<datetime>): A recommendation is expected within nine months, and Berkeley could vote on a ban by early 2018.\n-User (<datetime>): Alternatives have, in fact, been around since at least 3000 B.C., when the first known straw was sealed inside a Sumerian tomb. The gold tube, inlaid with precious stone, was apparently used for drinking beer. Rye grass was fashioned into straws in the United States until 1888, when a man named Marvin Stone invented the paper straw so the flavor of rye wouldn\u2019t tarnish his mint julep.\n-User (<datetime>): Plastic straws were first used in the early 1960s, and by the 1970s they had largely replaced Stone\u2019s invention.\n-User (<datetime>): Now, the solution eyed by many conservationists would see restaurants switch back to paper or encourage customers to buy reusable straws made out of stainless steel, glass or bamboo. Gwyneth Borden, executive director of the Golden Gate Restaurant Association, said many higher-end restaurants have voluntarily switched to biodegradable substitutes.\n-User (<datetime>): \u201cBans like what Berkeley is proposing don\u2019t hurt the big restaurants; they hurt the smaller mom-and-pop restaurants,\u201d said Borden, who nevertheless believes San Francisco and other cities will follow Berkeley\u2019s lead. \u201cThe problem with being at the forefront of these movements is that there are added costs, and it takes time and effort to comply.\u201d\n-User (<datetime>): Ernesto Quintero, the owner of Saturn Cafe, a vegetarian diner on Allston Way in Berkeley, said he spent the past few years searching for a compostable product, only to find that all the straws he tried went limp in liquid. Finally, last year, he found a thick paper straw designed by an Indiana company called Aardvark.\n-User (<datetime>): \u201cMost people want a straw when they have a milk shake, so we really just kept hunting,\u201d said Quintero, who expects prices for alternatives to drop once more businesses start using them. \u201cWe\u2019re probably paying seven or eight times more for the straw, so it\u2019s certainly not a cost-saving move, but for us we felt like it was both ethically and morally the right thing to do.\u201d\n-User (<datetime>): The moral argument has gained momentum with activist groups and websites attracting more followers, and with the release of a 30-minute documentary narrated by actor Tim Robbins called \u201cStraws.\u201d\n-User (<datetime>): The straw-free movement can be found in places as far-flung as Milwaukee, Vancouver, B.C., and London. City officials in Davis recently carved out their own approach, requiring restaurants to ask patrons if they would like a straw, instead of automatically providing one. At least two restaurants in San Diego have voluntarily taken similar actions.\n-User (<datetime>): Councilwoman Hahn and others say the banning of plastic straws could help Berkeley and other cities meet mandates set by the San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board to reduce the amount of trash choking creeks, polluting marshlands and fouling the Bay Area shoreline.\n-User (<datetime>): \u201cIn the same way people are adapting to bringing their own shopping bags to the grocery store,\u201d Hahn said, \u201cI\u2019m really confident people will learn how to drink again witho",
