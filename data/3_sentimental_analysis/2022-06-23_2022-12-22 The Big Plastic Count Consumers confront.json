  "readable_content": "- futurologyBot (2022-12-08): The following submission statement was provided by u/filosoful:\nIt's hard not to feel guilty about the price our planet pays for plastic.\nBut when most affordable products come with plastic packaging, are we as consumers really in control?\nFor one week in May, more than 100,000 people in the UK carefully counted their plastic waste at home in a national investigation into plastic use and recycling. It was called the Big Plastic Count, run by organisations Greenpeace and Everyday Plastic.\nJules Birkby, 41, and her family of four threw away 124 pieces of plastic during their week of counting. The packaging in party bags and sticker packs for her daughter Emmy's sixth birthday was the most frustrating, she says.\n\n- alicat2308 (2022-12-08): This is why I get annoyed when consumers \"addiction to plastic\" is blamed for the pacific garbage patch. Like, it's not like the average person in 2022 has a lot of choice.\nEdit: I see the Personal Responsibity Fairy has visited while I was asleep \ud83d\ude04\n\n- frostixv (2022-12-08): Much of the corporate narrative is to pass industry induced problems off to consumers. Frankly every business strategy is to pass as many of its own costs externally as it can get away with to improve profit margins. It's a race to the bottom in competitive environments which requires focusing on exploiting oversight, lack of regulation, grey areas, etc.\n\n- [deleted] (2022-12-08): The 'Carbon Footprint' was a term coined by an advertizing agency for BP Oil- specifically to create guilt in climate-aware individuals and focus them on their use, rather than regulating the companies producing the real waste.\n'Plastic Footprint' may have been coined by ppl wanting to do good, but it is perpetuating individual guilt to distract from corporate greed.\n\n- Kirk_Kerman (2022-12-08): Also, end user plastic use is nothing compared to industrial use. I've worked in logistics and every single item someone might buy has been wrapped in meters and meters of plastic. Every component of a product shipped to be assembled for sale was individually wrapped in more plastic than you would produce in a year of using those plastic produce bags. Often you'd cut the plastic wrap off a pallet of goods, then restack the pallet and rewrap it for shipping.\n\n- mangirtle77 (2022-12-08): It\u2019s almost impossible. Whole Foods use plastic for fruit containers as do most places now. Plastic is everywhere. To slow it down there needs to be a mandate to produce a certain percentage of packaging from renewable resources. That\u2019s the only way. Recycling is highly ineffective and most of the time not even done despite claims.\n\n- TiredPanda69 (2022-12-08): I don't produce plastic in massive quantities.\nIf i need a product and it comes in plastic that is not on me. The people who produce the trash should be responsible for its waste management.\nA trash tax would be appropriate IF the corporations who produced the trash in the first place didn't have the power to just roll it back after a few years due to some bullshit \"free\" market excuse that makes the consumer responsible. Oh wait, that is whats happening now.\n\n- Beginning_Bed1306 (2022-12-08): Can we please make MANUFACTURERS stop using so much plastic? If every single consumer did everything they could we would still have a problem.\n\n- collapsingwaves (2022-12-08): Most pieces of packaging already have a manufacturers name on it. If it gets to the recycling center, and it can't be recycled, the manufacturer should be fined, and compelled to change the packaging. It's not hard. They are already telling us who is producing the problem.\n\n- DrunkenMidget (2022-12-08): One option is to remove the plastic in the store you buy it from..let the store start dealing with the waste. If enough people did this the store would start to notice for sure.\n\n- PiggehPerson (2022-12-08): I work in a retail store, and almost every single thing we sell is individually plastic wrapped. I spend a ton of time trying to get things out of plastic bags that I could be spending putting products on shelves. It makes me sick\n\n- drdookie (2022-12-08): Everything you can buy is wrapped in plastic and then thrown away. Somewhere along the chain there is always plastic.\n\n- sirpoopingpooper (2022-12-08): Contrarian view here: plastic consumption specifically pretty much doesn't matter. Consumption and excessive packaging do. More packaging means more carbon footprint. Didn't matter if it's plastic, glass, aluminum, or anything else. Plastic might even be better on an emissions perspective than some of the alternatives, and that's the only perspective that matters right now. Landfills are basically unlimited, so why not use them? Pretty much all the plastic waste getting into the environment are either microplastics from washing our clothes or cigarette filters. So plastic packaging/straws/whatever else are just a distraction from the real problem: co2 emissions. Instead of buying the fancy food in single use glass bottles, buy the Costco bulk version and use the savings to upgrade to heat pumps and upgrade your insulation\n\n- CS_2016 (2022-12-08): When companies are spilling millions of barrels of oil in the ocean, racing to destroy the rainforest, and adding more CO2 in a week than I will my entire life, I\u2019m not so concerned if I have plastic wrap on my purchases.\n\n- shadowgattler (2022-12-08): \"Wow, shame on you, consumers. How dare you be so wasteful\" - every corporation who makes these products with an absurd amount of plastic instead of alternatives.\n\n- FrankensteinBionicle (2022-12-08): My gf's cousin brought up a topic like this the other day but it was about recycling rainwater...",
  "summary": "The sentiment of the conversation about plastic usage and responsibility is generally against placing the blame on individual consumers and highlights the role of corporations in creating excessive plastic waste. There is a call for regulations and accountability for manufacturers rather than putting the burden on consumers. Overall, the sentiment is critical of the narrative that places the responsibility solely on individuals. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
