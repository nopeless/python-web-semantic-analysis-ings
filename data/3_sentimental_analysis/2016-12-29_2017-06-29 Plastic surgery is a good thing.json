Everyone wants to shove their goddamn morals onto everyone else.\n- [deleted] (2016-12-25): it's pathetic. Peopel need to accept they're bad looking, and get confidence from other ways.\n- [deleted] (2016-12-25): Morality is also an aspect of yourself that are very important to others. Makes it easy to judge people as well.",
