  "readable_content": "- User (2023-12-08): While out to a restaurant, a grocery store, a fast-food establishment, or a bar, you might\u2019ve noticed an influx in eco-friendly straws, or maybe you aren\u2019t offered a straw at all. If you ask, you\u2019re probably told some hurried, vague explanation involving the environment, specific legislature, and the ocean. You got some information, but not really enough to go on, right? There\u2019s more to it than just laws and environmentalists, so let\u2019s get into the many problems and disadvantages of plastic straws.\n\n  Stats On Plastic Straws\n  Australian scientists estimate that there are approximately 7.5 million plastic straws just polluting the U.S shorelines, and anywhere from 437 million and 8.3 billion plastic straws cluttering shorelines across the globe. That seems excessive, right?\n\n  But then, plastic straws are just a small fraction of the 8 million metric tons of plastic that goes into the ocean each year. Straws are an even smaller fraction of the 2.5 billion metric tons of waste that are produced around the world. See how it all adds up?\n\n  According to this other infographic, about 500,000 plastic straws are used daily. Plus, they estimated that 100,000 marine animals die due to plastic debris in their ecosystem.\n\n  Even with those stats, according to a beach cleanup volunteer organization, straws were the seventh most common piece of trash found in 2018. Seventh most. That\u2019s following cigarette butts, food wrappers, plastic bottles, plastic bottle caps, plastic grocery bags, and other plastic bags such as garbage sacks. They claim that there are enough straws found on the beaches to reach the height of 10,000 palm trees and that the total weight of the trash is equal to about 812 anchors.\n\n  - Sarah Everett (2023-12-08): Wow!
