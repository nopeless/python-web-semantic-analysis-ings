  "readable_content": "user (2023-12-08): This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center\u2019s Ocean Reporting Network.\nMore than 1,000 delegates from 175 countries are gathered in Nairobi this week to discuss the issue of plastic pollution. The focus is on creating a treaty that would govern all stages of the plastic lifecycle, from production to disposal. The hope is that such a treaty would result in decreased plastic production, lower carbon emissions, better recycling and waste collection, as well as more reusable products and products made from recycled materials, all contributing to a healthier environment.\n\nThe negotiations are currently in their third round, and a \"zero draft\" of a possible treaty document has been put forward. However, the level of ambition of the final agreement is still being debated, with different proposals on the table, ranging from ambitious global bans on all single-use plastic packaging to more apathetic national-level reductions.\n\nOne impactful proposal suggests that all new plastic products and packaging must be made from a minimum amount of recycled material, which could significantly reduce ocean pollution. Additionally, there are suggestions for bans on problematic chemical additives used in plastic production that are harmful to human health.\n\nThe article also outlines how an ambitious treaty could impact daily life, mentioning potential changes in packaging, recycling processes, and waste management systems. It also notes the potential losses for fossil fuel producers and petrochemical companies, as well as the need for a just transition for those whose livelihoods depend on these industries.",
