We are working hard to eliminate non-recyclable plastics and invest in innovative, alternative delivery systems, including bulk, reuse and refill options.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Unilever said: \"We\u2019ve committed to halve our use of virgin plastic in our packaging in just five years and reduce our total use of plastic by more than 100,000 tonnes. This demands a fundamental rethink in our approach to packaging and products, and as we speak, we\u2019re piloting different reuse and refill formats across the world, so we can test, learn and scale these solutions.\"\n\nA PepsiCo spokesperson said: \"We are working to reduce the amount of plastic we use and have set a target to, by 2025, decrease virgin plastic content across our beverage business by 35 per cent. Between July 2018 and 2019 we pledged over $51m to global partnerships designed to boost recycling rates to support a circular economy.\"\n\nA Coca-Cola spokesperson, said: \"We are absolutely committed to ensuring the packaging in which we serve our products is sustainable and our efforts are focused on continuing to improve the eco-design and innovation of our packaging.

  "summary": "The post discusses a report revealing the significant plastic pollution footprint of major drinks companies and calls for a reduction in the production and sale of single-use plastic packaging. The companies are urged to move towards refillable and reusable models and to report, reduce, and recycle the single-use plastics they sell in developing countries. The companies have responded with commitments to make their packaging recyclable, reduce their use of virgin plastic, and invest in alternative delivery systems.
