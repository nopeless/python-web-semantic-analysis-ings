To achieve this objective, the present study employed a two-tier analysis, including a systematic review of literature and bibliometric analysis of 164 scholarly articles spanning 1999 to 2022. The results underline the multidisciplinary nature of this research domain, characterized by a significant upswing in publications. The dominant countries in this field are identified as Brazil, Australia, and the USA. A noteworthy collaboration dynamic between the Chinese Academy of Sciences, East China Normal University, and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences has emerged, signaling opportunities for enhanced cross-border cooperation. Jambeck, who provided data support for this research field, is found as the most cited author. Marine Pollution Bulletin, Environmental Pollution, and Science of the Total Environment are the most prolific journals discussing such topics. The primary research clusters in this field include seasonal comparison, Qinghai Lake, and small plastic debris. Additionally, scholars have recently focused on new topics such as seasonal comparison, case study, spatial pattern, and the Southern Baltic Sea in the last 3 years. This research also reports 10 articles with the highest citations and 10 highly cited papers. Not only this, the present study presents the inaugural bibliometric analysis on plastic pollution in coastal and marine tourism. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, it stands as a pioneering investigation of its nature, offering a comprehensive view on the research domain by evaluating a time span exceeding two decades, with a specific emphasis on the literature pertaining to marine tourism.\n\n- Introduction\n- Human activities have negatively affected the coastal areas\u2019 environment and biodiversity (Cherif et al., 2020), which has impacted coastal tourism, the primary driver of the economy of coastal cities worldwide (Mejjad et al., 2022; Schaffer & Tham, 2019; Scherrer, 2020). Coastal tourism refers to a procedure in which tourists, along with the destinations and local communities they visit, are involved (Brand\u00e3o et al., 2019. The majority of coastal tourism activities typically take place in areas close to the shoreline, encompassing both the coastal land and the adjacent waters (Mejjad et al., 2022). Coastal tourism can have substantial economic benefits for humans. For example, Yepes and Median (2005) revealed that despite comprising a mere 0.001% of Spain\u2019s land area, beaches account for approximately 10% of the country\u2019s Gross National Product. However, the tourism industry\u2019s operations can have detrimental effects on the environment, including but not limited to climate change, natural resource depletion, water and air pollution, and intensified strain on endangered species (Grelaud & Ziveri, 2020). Additionally, coastal tourism activities have also caused a massive loss of biodiversity, land occupation, aquaculture, and broad habitats (Nammalwar, 2021). In particular, plastic pollution from tourism activities has been increasing and remains one of the biggest environmental threats (Darvishmotevali & Altinay, 2022; Grelaud & Ziveri, 2020, Tsai et al., 2021; Thushari & Senevirathna, 2020).\n\n- There is no doubt that plastics have contributed significantly to human progress and development in many aspects; nevertheless, the distribution of plastic debris in the environment has become a serious issue (Fadare et al., 2020; Jiale & Quoquab, 2023; M. H. Wang et al., 2019). The ocean contains a significant amount of litter, with plastic debris comprising the highest proportion. Specifically, plastic waste accounts for 80% of all marine waste. It was revealed that in 2020, the USA produced around 42\u2009Mt of plastic waste in 2016, of which 0.14 to 0.41\u2009Mt was discarded into the land and water (Law et al., 2020). According to Jambeck et al. (2015), 4.8 to 12.7\u2009million metric tons of plastic litter entered the ocean from coastal countries. Plastic can be found on every continent\u2019s shorelines, with more plastic waste close to popular tourist destinations such as Zanzibar\u2019s coastline (Maione, 2021), and Colombian Caribbean beaches (Williams et al., 2016). It is noted that the ubiquitous plastic litter can damage the aesthetic of beaches and then reduce the number of tourists and revenue (Jang et al., 2014). In addition, plastic pollution can significantly impact ecological diversity, human health, and marine animals (Chaudhry & Sachdeva, 2021; Khadanga et al., 2022). As the awareness of the detrimental effects of plastic pollution continues to rise, more scholars suggested that mitigating plastic pollution should be the priority in processing coastal tourism litter (Courtene-Jones et al., 2021; Portman & Brennan, 2017; Thushari & Senevirathna, 2020).\n\n- Currently, single-use plastic has become the primary source of plastic pollution in some tourism destinations (Maione, 2021). One possible reason is using facemasks as the prevention mechanism during the outburst of COVID-19. It is estimated that more than 95% of facemasks are single-use that can be found on a tourist beaches (Mghili et al., 2022). Unfortunately, it can release many nanoplastics and microplastics in coastal tourism areas (Ma et al., 2021). Due to the growing threat and challenge of plastic pollution to the coastal tourism industry, it is crucial to present a comprehensive and unbiased overview of plastic pollution in coastal tourism which is unfortunately, missing in the existing literature. This would aid researchers and policymakers in gaining a better understanding of the current state of research and knowledge related to this phenomenon. To meet this demand and address the research gap, the present study offers a bibliometric analysis of plastic pollution in coastal tourism.\n\n- Past studies have used bibliometric analysis to investigate literature related to",
