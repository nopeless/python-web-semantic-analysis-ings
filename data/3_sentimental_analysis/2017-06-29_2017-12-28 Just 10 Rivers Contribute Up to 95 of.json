  "readable_content": "CARYLSUE (2017-11-06):\nJust 10 Rivers Contribute Up to 95% of River-Based Ocean Pollution\n\n- The article discusses the major contributors to ocean pollution, attributing almost four million tonnes of plastic dumping into the ocean annually to just 10 rivers. The post includes a discussion of marine debris, analysis of the sources of mismanaged plastic waste, and insights into why these 10 rivers disproportionately contribute to river-based plastic marine debris.\n\n- Notable findings include that most marine debris comes from land-based activities, with the remaining 20% originating from marine activities. Furthermore, the post emphasizes the misinterpreted claims about the research stating that 95% of plastic pollution comes from just ten rivers, clarifying that the research indicates between 88% and 95% of plastic pollution is attributable to these rivers.\n\n- Economic, population density, and location factors are highlighted as significant contributors to the disproportionately high river pollution caused by these 10 rivers. The post also includes a list of resources for further reading and understanding of the topic.\n\n- The comments include various reactions and expressions of concern about the impact and implications of the study's findings.\n\n---PINGBACK: How to help while you visit Siem Reap... - Plastic Free Cambodia\n---lk f (2018-07-15 10:30 PM):\n---Concluding Yangzi River after just multiplying the population and a subjective mismanagement rate?
