This is especially true in the ocean, where about 11 million metric tons of plastic are dumped each year\u2014an amount that is projected to nearly triple by 2040 without urgent, large-scale action, according to research by **The Pew Charitable Trusts** and **SYSTEMIQ**, a London-based sustainability consultancy. The two organizations detailed their findings in a 152-page report, released in July and titled \u201cBreaking the Plastic Wave,\u201d and a peer-reviewed study in the journal Science that was published online July 23 and in print Sept. 18 (and that also included data on plastic pollution on land).\n\nPlastic in the ocean comes in myriad familiar forms, from shopping bags and takeout food containers to water bottles, toothbrushes, toys, bubble wrap, household appliances, and much more, the report noted. Plastic has been found along virtually every coastline on the planet and throughout the seas, including its deepest and most remote regions. According to the report, if current production, distribution, consumption, and disposal continue at their current pace, 29 million metric tons of plastic would enter the ocean annually by 2040, the equivalent of dumping 110 pounds (50 kilograms) of plastic on every meter of coastline around the world.\n\nA warehouse full of household materials awaits recycling at a Melbourne, Australia, company that has gone bankrupt. The state government and the warehouse owners do not know what to do with the largely unsorted material, which cannot be easily sold to facilities able to process it. As a result, Melbourne municipalities are sending thousands of tons of recyclable waste to landfills.\nJason South The Age via Getty Images\n\nBut there\u2019s still time to reverse this trend and, encouragingly, the technology and methodologies to do so already exist. Using first-of-its-kind modeling, Pew and SYSTEMIQ looked at six scenarios to reduce plastics, ranging from worst case\u2014what the report labels \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d\u2014to a best-case \u201csystem change\u201d that would demand a significant revamping of plastics design, production, sale, use, disposal, and recycling. The research found that the system change scenario would reduce the annual flow of plastic waste into the ocean by about 80% by 2040, with action by government and industry leaders driving much of the change.\n\n\u201cThe scale of this challenge is daunting,\u201d says Winnie Lau, senior manager of Pew\u2019s ocean plastics program and lead author on the Science study. \u201cUnless we act, by 2040 the amount of plastic going into the ocean would triple annually, and the amount in the ocean would nearly quadruple. That\u2019s unimaginable and unsustainable.\u201d\n\nLau adds that governments and businesses already have the tools and resources they need, noting that \u201cwe don\u2019t have to wait for any new invention or new technology to put a big dent in the problem.\u201d But, she says, \u201cthe work must start now. Waiting even five years would allow an additional 80 million metric tons of plastic to enter the ocean.\u201d\u00a0\n\nThe report reflects more than two years of work by the Pew ocean plastics initiative. Plastic, which is made largely from oil, was invented in the 19th century but didn\u2019t go into widespread use until the mid-20th century. Production soared from 2 million metric tons in 1950 to 348 million metric tons in 2017\u2014an amount that would double by 2040 under the business-as-usual scenario. Today\u2019s global plastics industry is valued at $523 billion.\n\nBreaking the Plastic Wave\n\nAs plastic has proliferated, so too has the science showing some of the human health impacts throughout the plastic life cycle, from the effects of raw material extraction and production on neighboring communities to the chemicals in food packaging and the deleterious impacts of mismanaged waste. Around the world, plastic waste has blocked rivers and drainage systems, causing flooding and trapping stagnant water that exacerbates the spread of disease. Open burning of plastic waste pollutes air and water, emitting toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases; in 2016, such burning released an estimated 1 gigaton of equivalent carbon dioxide, a figure that\u2019s expected to more than double\u2014to 2.1 gigatons\u2014under the business-as-usual scenario, according to the Pew-SYSTEMIQ report.\n\nAnd in the past 20 years, numerous studies have found plastic compounds in much of the seafood that people eat, adding another potential layer of negative health consequences to the equation.\n\n95% of plastic packaging is used in one-and-done products.\n\nOne major issue in solving the problem is that plastic is virtually indestructible. Pew\u2019s Lau points out that \u201cthere are practically no natural processes that can degrade plastic back into the ecosystem. Some people say plastic might break down after a few hundred years\u2014but we don\u2019t know, because we haven\u2019t lived with plastic that long. It will stay with us, maybe forever.\u201d\n\nAnother huge part of the problem is that 95% of plastic packaging is used in one-and-done products, including items such as condiment packets, food wrapping, and bubble wrap, which means that their life cycle is linear: They\u2019re produced, sold, used, and discarded with little chance of being recycled. The ultimate goal, Pew and SYSTEMIQ say, is a circular plastics economy, one in which the need for new plastic production and the waste disposal of existing plastic decline significantly. Those changes would require dramatic drops in production and use of plastics, as well as substantial increases in reuse and recycling.\n\nToday, although 71% of the plastic produced is formally collected after use\u2014a figure that doesn\u2019t include what\u2019s gathered by informal waste pickers around the world\u2014less than 15% is actually recycled. This gap is due, in large part, to two factors: the higher cost of recycled versus raw plastic, and the fact that problematic plastic such as sachets, thin bags, and films cannot be economically recycled. To make a dent in the problem, companies need to make far less plastic than they do today, and recycling needs to ramp up significantly, although neither of those solutions on its own, the report says, would suffice: Improved recycling could reduce the flow of plastic into the seas by 20%, while reducing the production of plastic would yield a 30% drop, numbers that even when combined aren\u2019t enough to stave off severe environmental consequences.\n\nBreaking the plastic wave, Pew and SYSTEMIQ say in the report, requires \u201cimmediate, ambitious, and concerted actions.\u201d The report calls for eight interventions:\n\n- Reduce plastic production.\n- Substitute paper and compostable materials.\n- Design products and packaging for recycling.\n- Expand waste collection rates in middle- and low-income countries.\n- Increase mechanical recycling.\n- Develop plastic-to-plastic chemical recycling.\n- Build facilities that don\u2019t allow plastic to leak out.\n- Reduce plastic waste exports.",
