This disposable item, used globally and found in most drinks at restaurants, has been accumulating in oceans, negatively affecting marine wildlife and birds. Plastic straws don't break down and produce microplastics. These harmful particles are ingested by animals, presenting a significant threat. To combat this, small lifestyle changes, such as using alternative, environmentally-friendly straws, can help save marine ecosystems.\n\nAdditionally, car donation programs like Wheels For Wishes have a positive impact on the environment by recycling vehicle donations, with the proceeds benefiting children facing critical illness through Make-A-Wish.
