  "body": "Plastic rubbish often ends up in the ocean. The sheer amount of plastic that has been generated in the past 60 years is mind boggling. New research shows that we've produced plastic as heavy as 1 billion elephants since the 1950s. Even more staggering is the amount that has rapidly become waste. Just 9% of this plastic has been recycled.",
  "readable_content": "- Greenpeace International (2023-12-08): We know our oceans and coastlines are choking on plastic, but how does all that plastic get into the ocean? We've all seen plastic bottles, food wrappers, and plastic bags polluting beaches. Plastic waste is a major issue, with up to 12 million tonnes entering oceans annually. The article goes on to explain that about 80% of ocean litter comes from land, and various sources contribute to this, including tourism, industrial processes, and even personal care and cosmetic products. The text emphasizes the need for corporates to reduce single-use plastic and for governments to improve waste management to tackle the issue at its source.\n\nSource: Greenpeace International",
