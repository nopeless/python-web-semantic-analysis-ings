  "readable_content": "CowBoyDanIndie (2023-11-26): At this point the only solution for plastic pollution are fungi and bacteria that eat plastic that make them biodegradable, they already exist, they just haven't evolved to survive enough environments yet to be useful.\n\n- Spacey907 (2023-11-26): is it possible to set up a greenhouse that has the desired temp, soil, sunlight in each region that is isolated from the rest of the environment and weather, predators that feed on them. i could be wrong but wouldnt it be similar to growing a garden since your able to control the inside environment so the fungi and bacteria can thrive. but i think too much and not sure if society is willing to change for the better",
  "summary": "The conversation expresses hope in the potential of fungi and bacteria to combat plastic pollution. Spacey907 suggests the possibility of setting up controlled environments to support the growth of such organisms. However, there is also a note of skepticism about whether society is willing to change for the better. Overall, the sentiment seems hopeful about the potential solutions but doubtful about societal change.\nSentiment: 0.5",
