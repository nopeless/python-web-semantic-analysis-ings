These modern conveniences are so ubiquitous\u2014and so quickly thrown out\u2014that they hardly register in our minds. But single-use plastics come with a steep environmental price\u2014one that we\u2019ll be paying off for millennia. Our plastic addiction is having a devastating impact on our oceans, our wildlife, and our health.\n- Guest (2023-12-08): [...]\n- Guest (2023-12-08): What Are Single-Use Plastics?\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Why Is Single-Use Plastic Bad?\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Single-Use Plastics and Pollution\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Should We Ban Single-Use Plastics?\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Avoiding Single-Use Plastics\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Put simply, single-use plastics are goods that are made primarily from fossil fuel\u2013based chemicals (petrochemicals) and are meant to be disposed of right after use\u2014often, in mere minutes. Single-use plastics are most commonly used for packaging and serviceware, such as bottles, wrappers, straws, and bags.\n- Guest (2023-12-08): [...]\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Single-use plastics are a glaring example of the problems with throwaway culture. Instead of investing in quality goods that will last, we often prioritize convenience over durability and consideration of long-term impacts. Our reliance on these plastics means we are accumulating waste at a staggering rate. We produce 300 million tons of plastic each year worldwide, half of which is for single-use items. That\u2019s nearly equivalent to the weight of the entire human population.\n- Guest (2023-12-08): [...]\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Although single-use plastic pollution accumulates most visibly on our streets, in fact our water suffers even more. Litter can be the first stage in a waste stream that enters waterways as plastics tossed on the street are washed away by rain or travel via storm drains into rivers and streams. Our waterway plastic pollution is particularly concentrated: Just ten rivers carry 93 percent of the world\u2019s total amount of plastic that enters the oceans via rivers each year.\n- Guest (2023-12-08): [...]\n- Guest (2023-12-08): An albatross found dead with a belly full of plastic on Midway Atoll\n- Guest (2023-12-08): [...]\n- Guest (2023-12-08): Our addiction to plastic also has negative impacts on the climate. A recent report showed that plastic production contributes to planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions at every point in its life cycle. The process of drilling for plastic\u2019s source materials, oil and gas, leads to methane leaking and flaring and is often combined with clearing forests and wetlands that otherwise would have sequestered carbon.
