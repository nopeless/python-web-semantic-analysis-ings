  "readable_content": "- Variable_Interest (2017-06-21): Lettuce Entertain You Bans Plastic Straws at 120 Locations\n- [deleted] (2017-06-21): Good move. The White Sox Park did this too, and now uses paper straws.\n- [deleted] (2017-06-21): This message has been deleted\n- Area_Woman (2017-06-21): Best to not use a straw at all.\n- HAAAAAAALP_ (2017-06-21): Yeah...the paper straws are awful. I understand not using plastic straws, but how about just giving people a Twizzler or something.\n- avianaltercations (2017-06-21): Just wait. Someone is going to \"re-invent\" how we look at straws - industry-disrupting straws that not only reduce waste, but also is eco-friendly and green. That's right, someone is going to start making straws out of.... straw.\n- mrbooze (2017-06-21): Many disabled people need them, and metal straws are dangerous for people with lack of movement control.\n- DavidGuyon (2017-06-21): I was just in Hawaii and was pleasantly surprised that straws were banned across all of the islands. Keep this train rolling.\n- [deleted] (2017-06-21): This message has been deleted\n- Inspector-Space_Time (2017-06-21): Why can't we just use biodegradable plastic for straws? Paper straws are shit and metal straws are breeding ground for bacteria. Single use plastic is the best thing for straws, seems we should focus on fixing the problems with that instead of abandoning the superior technology all together. Biodegradable plastics are weaker than regular plastic but I doubt that'll make a difference in straws.\n- weberc2 (2017-06-21): iirc, the problem with straws is the impact on marine life. Pretty sure biodegradable plastics still take years to degrade, which probably would give them plenty of time to do damage? I'd be interested to hear from someone who knows more though.\n- Teruyo9 (2017-06-21): Price, mainly. Compostable/biodegradable plastic costs more to make than regular plastic or paper.\n- Stankia (2017-06-21): Why just not use straws at all?\n- [deleted] (2017-06-21): Landfills don\u2019t have proper airflow... not even vegetable scraps break down in them.\n- magfluor (2017-06-21): I\u2019ve seen a lot of places post that they\u2019re only offering straws upon request, happy to see it! Been trying to carry my own reusable utensils as well so I\u2019m not using too many plastic utensils\n- tonucho (2017-06-21): Good\n- [deleted] (2017-06-21): This message has been deleted",
