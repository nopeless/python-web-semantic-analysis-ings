  "readable_content": "- CNN Business (2023-12-08): Starbucks (SBUX) has officially introduced \"sippy cup\" lids for iced beverages, replacing plastic straws. The strawless lids will not be used for blended beverages or drinks with whipped cream, except where plastic straws are prohibited by law. This initiative is part of the company's effort to reduce its environmental footprint, with the lids containing 9% less plastic than the previous flat lid and straw combination. Starbucks aims to eliminate more than 1 billion plastic straws per year. Additionally, the company is working towards a 100% recyclable and compostable hot cup by 2022. This move aligns with Starbucks' broader sustainability efforts and its goal to become a \"resource positive company.\"",
  "summary": "The introduction of sippy cup lids by Starbucks to replace plastic straws is a positive step in reducing environmental impact. The initiative to minimize plastic waste and work towards recyclable and compostable packaging aligns with broader sustainability efforts. This reflects a responsible and forward-thinking approach by Starbucks. Sentiment: 0.8",
