The story telling in this full version video is not as rich as I have expected. I think they should add more short clips illustrating the two characters. Let the viewers know what kind of people they are, how much they are in common. And there needs more scenes of their unexpected acquaintances, to make their feelings for each other develop more naturally. The 2 minutes preview version got me interested, but the longer version ruined it...\n\n- subarusakurazuka (2020-11-21):\n  Where are this from? Is it possible to buy this music video somewhere?\n\n- sawgrass_boss (2020-11-21):\n  You're a saint!
