  "readable_content": "- PM_Pics_of_ur_pups (2020-12-08): I\u2019ve been on the other side of this coin. I had a fire pit in my backyard and had no idea how bad the smoke was up the hill. At some point a neighbor up the hill left \u201chelpful tips\u201d on using and maintaining fire pits on all the mailboxes in my culdesac. I was the only one with one, so it was for me. I guess it was a nice way to notify me without having to confront me?\n- tdasnowman (2020-12-08): Just go have a conversation. Smoke either means green wood, or the fire isn't hot enough and just smoldering. They may not be aware of how far the smoke is traveling as well.\n- actuallivingdinosaur (2020-12-08): This qualifies under the nuisance and quality of life ordinances. More so because the smoke can affect your health (this applies to tobacco and marijuana as well if it enters your home). Have a friendly chat with the neighbor first and let them know what is happening. If they are not receptive then you should contact the nonemergency line for your area and file a report.\n  Edit: I have dealt with both fire pit and tobacco/marijuana smoke issues and had to escalate it to the city. This is how the issue was resolved.\n- [deleted] (2020-12-08): How about this situation but instead of wood burning stove it's the neighbor with his 3-foot bong every morning at around 5?\n- handsome sharkman (2020-12-08): Give him a super heavy indica to smoke as a gift. When he falls asleep, hide the bong.\n- windoneforme (2020-12-08): Haha, I've got this situation. Small cul-de-sac with lots of families with small kids always out front playing. Guy down the street is smoking Marley-sized joints 3 times a day and smoking out the entire street. You can smell it from over 100 yards. He gives zero craps about it and claims it's his right and it's legal... We all agree he's a huge dick!\n- mpaull2 (2020-12-08): If it's a built-in, maybe they could extend the chimney?\n- bisselvacuum (2020-12-08): Denying a neighbor fresh air is not okay, especially in a town like San Diego where running AC 24/7 is NOT traditional at all.\n- sdcyclonesurfer (2020-12-08): I legitimately have no idea what I'm talking about but I've seen these smokeless portable fire pits and it seems there are reasons for fires to put off more smoke than others, be it airflow, not enough heat, wood is too wet/dry. You might talk to them and see if there are any options to cut the smoke down; otherwise, wait a week until the novelty wears off and they stop using it.\n- asianmarysue (2020-12-08): Are you in Mira Mesa? I've got a neighbor that burns the smelliest wood, just got the pit this summer too.\n- micros101 (2020-12-08): You on Flanders?\n- Ellexoxoxo33 (2020-12-08): We bought an industrial shop fan from Harbor Freight for around 130 dollars and positioned it on the patio to blow the smoke from our PitBoss smoker up and away from my neighbor's side yard/bedroom windows. We are a couple of miles from the beach and none of us have A/C.\n- koikatturtle (2020-12-08): I like this idea!! But in the case of the OP, I would face it toward the smoke and blow it away from my home.\n- DarlingCvdM (2020-12-08): I'm in the same situation, except closing our windows doesn't help and their smoke completely fills my yard. I'm super sensitive to smoke or any kind and I get a severe headache every time they use their outdoor oven/pit. To cause me additional stress, I have a baby who is also breathing in all the smoke - his fact irritates me the most.\nThis is a current struggle and has yet to be resolved. As of this point, I texted them with this link and screenshots. Hopefully, they take me seriously because the smoke is making my home comfort super sucky.\nThe link to the info about better wood-burning practices: https://www.firepit.co.uk/a/blog/smokeless-fire-pit-heaven-5-tips-to-reduce-fire-pit-smoke#:~:text=Use%20properly%20seasoned%20firewood,wood%20will%20cause%20additional%20smoke.\n- L273EF (2020-12-08): Move if you are sensitive. That is what apartment blocks are for. Control freaks.\n- ZeMouth (2020-12-08): This could be due to them burning soft woods. Much more smoke than burning hard woods AFAIK. They may just not know any better.\n- unlimitedupside (2020-12-08): Wood smoke IS Toxic, no joke. It can be very hazardous to people with Pulmonary or Cardiac issues.\nhttps://woodsmokepollution.org/toxins.html\n- L273EF (2020-12-08): You should move. Just sell and buy in a better location. The property value is permanently decreased, and you can\u2019t do anything about it.\n- Brick-Wilder (2020-12-08): Well, it might be considered a statutory nuisance, but I\u2019m not coming across any rules or regs in SD county that directly pertains to fireplace, BBQ smoke. The only thing I came across about fireplaces might be the distance to the house.\nDo you rent or own? (If you rent speak to your landlord)\nThe wood they are using might be wet which will cause a lot of smoke. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think you have much of a case. (Could be wrong) and I don\u2019t feel they need to run things by you for any reason.\nGood luck\nhttps://www.pacificpavingstone.com/blog/everything-need-know-building-fire-pits-southern-california-backyard/\nhttps://www.sandiego.gov/fire/services/policies/recreationalfire",
