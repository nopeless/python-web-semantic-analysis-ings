There is already a bunch of answers available.\nBut the basic gist is looks are very very important here and affects basically every faucet of society.

It's an extremely simple procedure.\n\n- Char_Aznable_Custom (2016-12-22): The amount of surgery people actually get is overblown but even the difference in attitude is very noticeable. It's just not seen as a big deal here. And while I don't personally agree with it I can see the validity of the view point. Basically: if you're dumb, you study; if you're fat, you diet; if you're weak, you lift weights; if you're ugly, you get surgery.\nPlastic surgery is just treated like an extension of makeup in the game of making yourself look better.",
