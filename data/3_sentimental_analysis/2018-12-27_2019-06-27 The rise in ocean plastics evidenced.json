Johns\u00a0\n\nIntroduction\n\nPlastics have become a global concern due to their accumulation in the world\u2019s oceans and potential health risks. Since the 1950s, there has been a significant increase in plastic production, leading to concerns about its impact on marine organisms and human health. Long-term records of the distribution and temporal trends of plastics in the world\u2019s oceans are limited. A consistent time series spanning 1957 to 2016, covering over 6.5 million nautical miles, based on records of plastic entanglement on a towed marine sampler, reveals a significant increase in open ocean plastics in recent decades.\n\nResults\nObservations\n\nA significant increase in macroplastic entanglement on a towed marine sampler was observed since 1957. The occurrence of macroplastic entanglement on the sampler shows a clear increasing trend with an order of magnitude increase from 2000 onwards. The records of macroplastics entangled on the sampler from 1957 to 2016 have a significant positive linear trend, while there is no significant trend for natural items. The findings confirm a significant increase in open ocean plastics since the 1990s.\n\nThe study is published in Nature Communications and authored by Clare Ostle, Richard C. Thompson, Derek Broughton, Lance Gregory, Marianne Wootton, and David G. Johns.\n\nThis text is used for informational purposes, and you may refer to the original source for the full article.",
