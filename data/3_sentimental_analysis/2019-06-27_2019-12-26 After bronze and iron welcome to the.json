  "readable_content": "The Guardian (2019-09-04): Plastic pollution is being deposited into the fossil record, research has found, with contamination increasing exponentially since 1945. Scientists suggest the plastic layers could be used to mark the start of the Anthropocene, the proposed geological epoch in which human activities have come to dominate the planet. They say after the bronze and iron ages, the current period may become known as the plastic age.",
  "summary": "The use of plastic has had a detrimental impact on the environment, leading to plastic pollution being deposited into the fossil record and increasing exponentially since 1945. This has raised concerns about the potential designation of our current period as the \"plastic age.\" The text conveys a sense of urgency and concern about the long-term effects of plastic pollution. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
