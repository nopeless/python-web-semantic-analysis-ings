  "readable_content": "user (2023-12-08): Skip to main content / navigation\nWelcome to the United Nations\n\nPlastics in soil threaten food security, health, and environment: FAO\n7 December 2021\n\nPlastic pollution has become pervasive in agricultural soils, according to a new report released on Tuesday by the UN agriculture agency, posing a threat to food security, people\u2019s health, and the environment.\n\nWhile plastic refuse littering beaches and oceans draws high-profile attention, the Food and Agriculture Organization\u2019s (FAO) Assessment of agricultural plastics and their sustainability: a call for action suggests that the land we use to grow our food is contaminated with even larger quantities of plastic pollutants.\n\nMaria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General, highlighted in the report\u2019s foreword that soils contain larger quantities of microplastics than oceans.\n\nAccording to FAO experts, agricultural value chains use 12.5 million tonnes of plastic products annually, with another 37.3 million used in food packaging, posing a significant threat to food security, people\u2019s health, and the environment.\n\nAsia was estimated to be the largest user of plastics in agricultural production, accounting for almost half of global usage. The demand for agricultural plastic continues to surge, prompting the need for better monitoring of these materials leaking into the environment.\n\nWhile plastic products in agriculture greatly contribute to productivity, almost 80% of the estimated 6.3 billion tonnes of plastics produced before 2015 had never been properly disposed of. The report suggests solutions based on the \"Refuse, Redesign, Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Recover\" model and recommends developing a comprehensive voluntary code of conduct for all aspects of plastics throughout agrifood chains.\n\nThe report also suggests the need for more research, especially on the health impact of micro- and nanoplastics, and emphasizes the importance of dealing with the issue of agricultural plastics holistically within the context of food security, nutrition, food safety, biodiversity, and sustainable agriculture.",
  "summary": "The text highlights the pervasive issue of plastic pollution in agricultural soils and the detrimental effects it poses to food security, human health, and the environment. The report emphasizes the urgent need for better monitoring of plastic materials leaking into the environment and suggests comprehensive solutions and research to address the issue holistically. The sentiment of the text is focused on raising awareness and addressing the pressing issue of plastic pollution in agricultural systems. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
