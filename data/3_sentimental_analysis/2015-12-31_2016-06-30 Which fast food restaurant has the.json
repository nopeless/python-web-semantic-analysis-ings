  "readable_content": "- [deleted] (8 yr. ago): Which fast food restaurant has the sturdiest straws?\n\nLooking for some good straws for use in arts & crafts. Normally I would buy these from a store, but I'm in the mood to eat a lot. Don't worry, I'll definitely make a purchase and not just walk in for straws. Also, besides strong, sturdy straws, which ones have the widest (diameter) or longest straws?\n\nEdit: Wendy's did have them easily grabbable so I went with Harvey's and McDonald's.\n\n- muleCacorn (8 yr. ago): Booster Juice.\n    - Seadsead (8 yr. ago): Froster Straws will give you the widest opening and possibly be the sturdiest. For standard drinking straws, maybe someone else can chime in?\n    - evilhomer0 (8 yr. ago): Bubble Tea straws\n    - ri-ri (8 yr. ago): Mac's Milk Slushie straws!\n    - Northern_Pain (8 yr. ago): Juice Monkey on Slater near Bank.\n    - StonedMasonry (8 yr. ago): Starbucks yo!!\n    - smitcolin (8 yr. ago): Hintonburger\n    - bensinep (8 yr. ago): McDonald's on Rideau St. has some stout straws.\n    - pikeface (8 yr. ago): Harvey's straws are orange and usually unguarded.\n    - brentyyz (8 yr. ago): Dairy Queen\n    - darcyWhyte (8 yr. ago): (YouTube link)\n    - gamefreak249 (8 yr. ago): I nominate this for random r/Ottawa question of the week!",
