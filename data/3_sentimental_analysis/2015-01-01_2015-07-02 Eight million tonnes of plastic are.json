  "readable_content": "user (2023-12-08): Eight million tonnes of plastic are going into the ocean each\u00a0year\n\nYou might have heard the oceans are full of plastic, but how full exactly? Around 8 million metric tonnes go into the oceans each year, according to the first rigorous global estimate published in Science today.\n\nThat\u2019s equivalent to 16 shopping bags full of plastic for every metre of coastline (excluding Antarctica). By 2025 we will be putting enough plastic in the ocean (on our most conservative estimates) to cover 5% of the earth\u2019s entire surface in cling film each year.\n\nAround a third of this likely comes from China, and 10% from Indonesia. In fact all but one of the top 20 worst offenders are developing nations, largely due to fast-growing economies but poor waste management systems.\n\nHowever, people in the United States \u2013 coming in at number 20 and producing less than 1% of global waste \u2013 produce more than 2.5 kg of plastic waste each day, more than twice the amount of people in China.\n\nWhile the news for us, our marine wildlife, seabirds, and fisheries is not good, the research paves the way to improve global waste management and reduce plastic in the waste stream.",
  "summary": "The post highlights the alarming amount of plastic entering the oceans each year, causing significant harm to marine life and ecosystems. It also emphasizes the need for improved global waste management and reduced plastic usage. The sentiment about banning plastic straws could be strongly in favor of it, given the devastating impact of plastic pollution on the environment. Sentiment: 0.9",
