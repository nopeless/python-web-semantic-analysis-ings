In charge of this collection is Jonathan Evans, an accomplished biology professor who has been introducing new programs and initiatives pertaining to ecology and sustainability at Sewanee for more than 20 years.\n\nEvans defined the herbarium as \u201ca plant resource center within an academic institution, like a university or a college, centered around a collection of plants,\u201d although a closer look reveals the importance of this element of Sewanee academia\u2013one which is grossly underestimated by the simple concept of \u2018a collection of plants,\u2019 and which has shaped the Cumberland Plateau in a number of vital and often overlooked ways.\n\nWhen Jonathan Evans first arrived at Sewanee, he inherited a collection of plants from former Sewanee botanist George Ramseur which he found in the basement of Woods Labs.\u2026\"",
