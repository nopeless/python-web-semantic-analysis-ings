  "readable_content": "- Sorin61 (2023-12-08): Paper straws not so eco-friendly, 90% contain toxic \u201cforever chemicals\u201d newatlas.com\n\n- OptimisticSkeleton: Can we just admit capitalism won\u2019t fix the problems capitalism created? We need entirely new modes of production and distribution because what we do now is killing the planet.\n\n- Rednaxila: Where do I research more about alternative models?\n\n- m2thek: I really don't think it's that big of an ask for:\n  - Restaurants to stop giving out straws by default\n  - People who know they want/need straws to be expected to carry one with them when they're out\n  - People who don't need straws to survive without them\n  - Restaurants to carry a very small amount of disposable straws in the event someone who absolutely needs one does not have one\n\n- Kes1980: This does not mean paper straws are as bad as plastic ones. If you throw away a paper straw with a thin coating of something water repellent, most of it would still biodegrade, where plastic doesn't.\n\n- Zoso03: Yup, it was never addressed, and this article is bad for not addressing it. Enough people hate paper straws, and this will add fuel to that fire without giving proper perspective\n\n- WhenVioletsTurnGrey: If I've learned anything it's that \"Saying you are doing a good thing is much more impactful than actually doing it\" , as far as most business is concerned.\n\n- Josh-Rogan_: Ban the f*cking things. Nobody needs to use disposable straws.\n\n- CowBoyDanIndie: It\u2019s hilarious how much people focus on straws. There are much much larger sources of single use plastic.\n\n- swagdu69eme: Why are people so insanely focused on straws? Are you aware that not using your car for a day or eating no meat one in a while will have way more impact than using disposable straws ever will?\n\n- FX_King_2021: And I was buying only paper straws thinking its eco-friendly.\n\n- Conscious-Shoe-4234: if, in a world of f250 dualie trucks you purchase a bicycle: \"they strip mined the earth for the aluminum in that frame\" is not an argument ever made in good faith.\n\n- Kowzorz: There are few ways to interact with this capitalist machine that are truly eco-friendly anymore.\n\n- GreenMirage: I used a hollowed out Goat rib bone from my curry meal when I was 9. My family threw it out saying it was degenerate and rural despite the fact we slaughtered the goat ourselves. \ud83d\ude06\n\n\ud83e\udd37 ivory > bone > titanium > steel imho for that eco-friendly drip.\n\n- heloguy1234: Why are we still using this shit in single use items? Common sense isn\u2019t going to solve this problem. We need regulation.\n\n- Sea_Comedian_3941: Why TF do you need a straw, and if you do, they should be reusable.\n\n- erikmongabay: Metal straw user here, don't like how the paper ones melt in your mouth anyhow...\n\n- FrozenFern: Seems like every solution ends up being its own problem a year later. At this point we need to just go back to homesteading or feudalism for 200 years and reset. Give nature time to bounce back\n\n- spamowsky: Is this truly shocking?",
