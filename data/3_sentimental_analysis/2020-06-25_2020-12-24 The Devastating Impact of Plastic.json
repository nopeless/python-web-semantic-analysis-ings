  "readable_content": "user (2023-12-08): Plastic debris is accumulating in our oceans at a steady and deadly rate. Conservative estimates suggest that eight million metric tons of plastic finds its way into the world\u2019s oceans every single year. That is equivalent to two Empire State Buildings\u2019 worth of plastic going into the ocean every month. Plastic pollution never completely biodegrades; instead, it just breaks down into small particles that remain in the ocean for years. These particles are consumed by seabirds, mammals, and even fish, with often fatal results.\n\nPlastic pollution will have far-reaching impacts on marine organisms and ecosystems for centuries to come. To prevent our oceans from becoming completely inundated with plastic, we need to tackle the issue at its source by preventing plastic from entering the environment in the first place. These two fact sheets, Plastic Peril and Choked, lay out the facts of plastic pollution and suggest ways to curb this deadly threat.",
