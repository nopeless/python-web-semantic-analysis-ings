  "body": "The UN Environment Assembly is creating a legally binding treaty to end plastic pollution, which accounts for 85% of all marine litter and has a huge impact on the environment and society. The treaty will need to address pollution, recycling, and health issues, as well as the circular economy and the role of the plastics industry.",

This week, delegates from more than 150 countries are expected to meet in Uruguay to begin negotiations for a historic global agreement to end plastic pollution.\n\nIn March, the United Nations Environment Assembly made a landmark decision to create a legally binding treaty that considers the lifecycle of plastics, from production through to innovative packaging, products and business models. The treaty is expected to be finalized by the end of 2024. Between now and then, negotiators will have the daunting task of devising and agreeing to rules and strategies for controlling plastic pollution. Nature explores three key issues and how the treaty could tackle them.\n\n-Pollution\nPlastic accounts for 85% of all marine litter. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) predicts that the amount of plastic in the ocean will nearly triple by 2040, adding 23 million to 37 million tonnes more waste every year.\n\n-Recycling\nCurrently only 9% of plastic waste is recycled, in part because plastic waste has little value. Scientists say that if it was worth something, more plastic would be reused, less would end up in the environment and there would be less need for new plastics, a concept called the circular economy.\n\n-Social and health implications\nAll over the world, but mainly in Asia, plastic waste is burnt. This reduces the volume of waste and prevents it from becoming breeding grounds for bacteria, viruses and mosquitos. But the burning is a major contributor to air pollution. Around 4.2 million people died as a result of outdoor air pollution in 2016, with 91% of those deaths in low- and middle-income countries. In low-income parts of Nairobi and Sylhet, a city in Bangladesh, plastic is part of the landscape and presents a substantial health hazard.",
  "summary": "The conversation discusses the growing concerns of plastic pollution and the potential for a global treaty to address the issue. It highlights the negative impact of plastic on pollution, recycling, and social and health implications, emphasizing the need for significant action. Overall, the sentiment is supportive of efforts to tackle plastic pollution and its associated problems. \n\nSentiment: 0.8",
