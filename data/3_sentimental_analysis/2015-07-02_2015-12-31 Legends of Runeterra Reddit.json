It and Attune are two of the only keywords in the game which are present on the unit in-hand but not the unit in-play, but unlike Attune, Attach only really exists on 4 units in the entire game, and 3 of them have no card text whatsoever.\n\nIt really feels like Attach should be treated similar to Capture and just exist as a card-text play effect, like \"Play: Attach me to an ally\", and you can then just elect to play the unit as-normal by not selecting anything.\n\nGranted, Attach's entire package has been rotated, and as I said it barely exists at all in the first place, so this isn't a pressing issue or anything. Still, I just find it interesting to think about the various oddities the game has in its wording and categorization, so when I remembered Attach exists it got me thinking.\n\nView full post\n- u/BruiserBison (2023-12-07): I won old school style\n  - Meme\n- u/Disastrous_Issue (2023-12-07): 6 changes to make Path of champions exponentially better and more fun to play\n  - Humor/Fluff\n- u/Barisamayuzde99 (2023-12-07): While all the people are playing new champs, I'm terrorizing people with some big elusives\n  - Gameplay\n- u/Substantial-Night866 (2023-12-07): Barbara\u2019s ability\n  - Game Feedback\n- u/CrossXhunteR (2023-12-07): Worlds Viewers Guide\n  - Discussion\n- u/LegendaryW (2023-12-07): Can we either swap this tabs or make so closed tabs remain closed even if you relaunch the game?\n  - Discussion\n- u/6Kaliba9 (2023-12-07): This match was quite the drama hahaha after being in disadvantage for the last 4 turns this is how it all ended.
