(I used this paper: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920379617301011)\n\nToday's technological society is spreading propaganda that nuclear fusion is a perfectly infinite and clean energy, and that it is the technology that will save humanity and the Earth's ecosystem. But when we analyze nuclear fusion through the lens of TK's seven propositions, we can see how deceptive this propaganda is. Nuclear fusion is not infinite nor clean. And it will accelerate the already fast ecological collapse.\n\nSelf-propagating system means a system that tends to promote its own survival and propagation. A system may propagate itself in either or both of two ways: The system may indefinitely increase its own size and/or power, or it may give rise to new systems that possess some of its own attributes.\n\nProposition 1. In any environment that is sufficiently rich, self-propagating systems will arise, and natural selection will lead to the evolution of self-propagating systems having increasingly complex, subtle, and sophisticated means of surviving and propagating themselves.\n- - (Info tooltip: Examples of self-propagating systems include biological organisms, technological developments, and economic systems.)\n\nIntroduction: Proposition 1 posits that in a sufficiently rich environment, self-propagating systems will emerge, and natural selection will drive the evolution of these systems, leading to increasingly complex means of survival and propagation. Applying Proposition 1 to nuclear fusion industries involves examining how these industries evolve in response to their environment and challenges, particularly considering the push for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources.\n- - 1.

Applying this proposition to nuclear fusion industries requires examining the potential negative environmental impacts associated with their development, particularly in the short-term perspective.\n- - 1.
