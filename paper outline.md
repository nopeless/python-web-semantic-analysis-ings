## Introduction

### Social media has enabled faster propagation of ideas

The plastic straw discussion has been the center of attention

### Initial theorization

We as a society is not used to the speed of information propagation and thus have made a mistake

### Surrounding topics

- greenwashing
- right to repair

### Plan

Using AI to analyze the propagation of information, provide a generally applicable response model to an environmental and social disaster

The plastic straw discussion is a good case study since it meets the following criteria

- it is an easy to understand problem, thus people can easily participate
- it affects everyone
- it is relatively recent and thus well documented on the internet
- it has a known, acute starting point that is tracable
- it is a social and environmental disaster and thus we can apply our understanding of other social and environmental disasters to it

## Case study: The plastic straw

### Facts

- plastic straws are not the problem
- common alternative, metal straws, are a worse solution
- recent studies point out that paper straws are not a good solution either

### The initial motive

- plastic straws are too ubiquitous
- we can do it easily
- everyone can participate

### The initial backlash

- disabled people
- plastic straws are not the problem

### The hurried response of lawmakers and industry

- bans of plastic straws

### The constructive backlash

- metal straws are not a good solution
- paper straws are not a good solution
- greenwashing argument

## Brief mention of other cases

- biofuel production
- hydropower dams
- plastic bag bans
- wind turbine vs birds

## Methodological pipeline

using chatgpt to analyze mass media and exact timelines of the propagation of information

### Execution details

Analyzed sources: 1220 articles/comments from 2015-01-01 to 2023-12-31

Relevant sources: 801 articles/comments out of 1220

Money paid to OpenAI for ChatGPT: $4.56 (around 3300 queries have been made in total)

Time spent on data collection: ~5 hours (automated)

### Results

As expected

However, a clean mathematical was found to be impossible to find as there isn't enough data to smooth out the wave. Additionally, it was evident that the concensus is not a simple wave.

### Statistical significance

Visually a lag of around 3 years was confirmed in reddit, and a lag around 2 years on twitter.

## Conclusion

From the data I suggest that measuring the reactions of people is a great way to measure the impact of bans and other environmental policies.
